{"product_reviews": {"1": {"asin": "B08SC42G8B", "reviews": ["Just so everyone knows. When you go to connect the camera. DO NOT USE THE QR CODE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. That code is for finding the app or something stupid. The instructions do not tell you that you are supposed to scan the code on top of the camera itself. There is absolutely nothing that tells you to that there is a code on the camera itself. So much frustrating time wasted baking in the sun waiting and waiting for search times. I almost returned the camera... Then upon disassembly we noticed the code on top of the camera and tried it in one last desperate effort. Instant connection... So 3 stars for that. Otherwise great camera so far. I love its tracking feature. And it has great night vision.", "This is a great camera overall and a very good unit for home surveillance applications. The packaging is good an it comes with everything you need to get started. It is nice that a mount is included. I mounted the unit on rails on my second story balcony overlooking my front yard. The angle of view is very good - it is pretty wide angle so you can cover a good sized area. The image quality is great both during the day and at night. It is nice that at night when a street light is on the camera stays in color. When it flips to the IR black and white mode the image quality is still good. The amazing feature of this camera is the human detection and auto tracking. I get a push notification through the mobile app almost instantly when a person is seen by the camera. I haven\u2019t really gotten any false alerts from it so far which is nice. The camera was a little bit tricky to get connected to my WiFi at first but it was because I was a little bit beyond the recommended 15 ft max distance from the WiFi router during initial installation. Once you bring the camera working the recommended 15 ft radius it was pretty easy to get it added to the mobile app. The app is pretty easy to use and has all the features you would want. Overall I think this camera is a great value for the price and would recommend it, especially for home surveillance because it had the built in WiFi and you only need to supply power to the camera.", "I have recently had to deal with neighbors who were trying to strong arm me. I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me. With my Samsung connected to my computer, I'm able to watch my blind spots without touching my phone. I wanted to close with how impressed I am with the quality of the recording. Very confident that with these cams and my blink system, any unlawful actions will be caught on cam which will be key to pressing charges. If you are on the fence, don't be. This is security at a very very reasonable price point :)Update: 10-11-21Pro...err n00b tip since I'm also learning :)The software will record 24/7 as long as you have Smart Scene set up. I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic. This is just what I've learned in the past week of operating and staring at my security system making sure the unstable people are captured if they try anything less than smart. Stay safe everyone!", "Cannot use this camera with the app or connect directly with port 80 for setup.  The app required the device password which is not admin therefore NOT usable.  WIFI direct to the cam does not work for the same reason, garbage......waste of time ordering this and returning it.  The doc says the pwd should be on the cam labeled as safety, but it is not... No possible way to use this device!", "This a must have product from Imou! I already have the Bullet 2MP and the Cue 1080p camera for a year already, but I needed one that includes Pan mode, and I like the easy Pan & Tilt feature on this one, beautiful night vision color mode and the smart tracking feature. Also for nightvision mode, you can choose wether on motion detection, turn spotlights on and get full color video or just IR recording. It has two spotlights which is very bright. I like how the camera goes in the moving object and record instantly. The Cruiser model is a must have into your shop or home outdoors.", "So far so goodCamera was pretty easy to get connected to WiFiDoes a good job letting me know if there\u2019s movementWould like motion tracking to be a little betterWould recommend this cameraHopefully I can say the same a year from nowI have went thru 3 other cameras so far.... they didn\u2019t work well after some time", "I can\u2019t say enough great things.

When they unboxed it, the power cord was damaged and could not even be plugged into the camera!

Total waste of money!", "My 3 cameras were kept disconnected from the Wi-Fi almost every 3 weeks even though it's only 6 feets away from the router, i have the powerful router that can reach 50 ft away. All cameras been install at outdoor of 2 floor of 2 story house and need at least 20 feet of ladder to climb up to reconnect to the Wi-Fi. The qualities were good but not reliable.Update 12/3/21I contacted the support from china regarding the problem that i had faced, the only thing that they suggested to change the IP address on every single camera without the further instructions how to do that. I sent the email asking about how and until now there's no replied from them, now I am stuck with this camera that kept disconnected from the WIFI every week.", "The camera is cute. I like it so much. And it is very easy to connect the router. I just followed the instructions in the Mobile APP, without the user manual. It has pretty nice picture quality.

The purpose was to not only be able to move the camera around the back yard but also have human detection capabilities. Set up was a breeze and the mounting style actually works well. Four screws and you\u2019re done. It requires an outlet for power, so keep that in mind when installing it.  Downloading the app and setting up the camera was smooth. Camera image and video is crystal clear.  The white led lights are very bright and work great at night. The infrared lights work well too.  WiFi connectivity works even better. The two large antennas allow it to lock on to the signal nicely. Overall, I\u2019m very impressed with this camera. Solid build and great image quality.", "The quality of this camera is outstanding.  It has excellent day time viewing and honestly has the best night vision i have seen yet of any wired or wireless camera.  Two way audio is very good overall, very little lag time and very distinct.  I like this brand over any brand yet I have installed or owned but I could not give it a 5 star rating.  I've had issues with connectivity of this wireless camera at even short range.  Also, the ptz function is not very responsive,  either it works or it just doesn't work at all.  For the price and picture quality this camera is the best option yet for wireless camera systems.", "For less than 100 bucks you can't beat this ptz. Very few have full color video at night, let alone clear and crisp color video. The motion tracking works well and having a home position to to return to is great. You can save multiple favorites and quickly pan to them. Wifi connection has been stable and the external antennas actually work unlike some that are for looks. The only issue I had with it was the flashing spotlight which was quickly fixed. Customer service is quick to respond. I would definitely recommend this ptz.", "There is a lot to like about this camera. Amazing clarity. Great range of motion. But no matter how I set the sensitivity or to only report human movement, I get 6 or 7 false alarms and have to shut it up. Luckily there are no neighbors nearby, because the alarm would wake them.

I think that the few negative comments have been made by people who don't understand the science of sampling and data collection.  They don't realize that with any device used for measurements, there will always be a sampling error.  They think if the device doesn't record the same result every time then there's a problem with the machine.  Yes, you can place the probe into soil at different locations in the same pot or garden area and it may record slightly different readings, say maybe 6 at one spot and 6.5 at another.  But for the price of this device, it is very accurate.  Also, many comments were made that they inserted the probe into a glass of water and it didn't read \"wet\", when the instructions clearly say not to do this.  There were comments made about the probe being a weak spot in the device, and would break off.  Yeah.... If you try to use this as a pick axe or a fence post.  You're not supposed to beat it into the ground with a sledge hammer.  It is a delicate instrument and should be treated as such.  Some people, in their reviews, imply that they stick the probe into the soil and leave it there as a permanent fixture, which you can't do.  If you treat this instrument with respect, gently insert it into the soil (without a hammer please) and then wipe off the steel probe with a cloth or even your hand, it seems to work perfectly.  And, as the directions state, don't insert it into a cup of water to test it.  If you want to test it for accuracy, insert the probe into a bundle of dry peat moss or potting soil, take the recording, and then add various amounts of water to the soil and retest.  Record the results you get and then you will have a guide as to what it means when the probe registers say, \"5 - moderate moisture\", or \"9 - very wet\", or \"2 - very dry\".  I think this is a great little instrument and an excellent value, and comes with a warranty.  I just received an email from the company reminding me that it has an 18 month warranty and to contact them if I have any issues.  I am a professional Mechanical Engineer as well as a practicing physician, with a hobby growing some exotic plants.  I think this is a great little instrument, with good accuracy, and not any more delicate than I would expect.  The price is great on Amazon, with free delivery, good communication from the seller and with a good warranty.  Definitely would recommend to my friends and buy again.", "I have 3 moisture meters. This is my favorite. I can use it one handed (which makes it quicker when watering my 60+ house plants), and there is just one probe (it goes in easily and comes out without flicking a bunch of dirt).The fancy green one has a list of plants and the number the plant should be at but it takes forever to scroll through my favorites the get at the plant I need. If I had fewer plants or fewer types of plants then maybe I would appreciate that feature...but in a world where time is limited I rather just memorize the plant's number and have my water in one hand and my meter in the other.The only thing I would caution you on with all meters are the suggested moisture levels. Cross check their info with other sources (the plants tag, online, the nursery where you bought it (unless it is a spontaneous buy at your grocery store which is where half of my plants have come from).Regardless of which meter you get, you should definitely get one. It has saved me numerous times from over watering what looked like a thirsty plant.", "Have you bought new plants and someone at the nursery or on the internets tell you to water once a week or two weeks? Well, guess what, your plants don't dry out on a schedule like that all year round. It depends on its environment. How much light it's getting, how hot and humid its surrounding is, what kind of soil and pot it's in. If you're a total newbie or you're just really into plants even after a series of failures like I was, then you need this moisture meter! It will tell you exactly when your plants need water. It'll stop you from killing that seventh string of pearls, whose six predecessors you drowned bc you were just born to overwater. It will help you water that fiddle leaf fig you love even though it's so 2016 (It's ok. I have two.)I have this simple moisture meter and another one that measures light, moisture and pH. I have two just because I have plants scattered all throughout the house and I don't wanna walk up and down the steps to get one. They're both useful to have.", "Best purchase ever and still wondering how the heck I made it this far without one? Probably killing plants that\u2019s how! This thing works, easiest to use and read. I had always gone with the \u201cstick your finger in the soil\u201d method but I personally find it so wrong, the soil at the top may be super dry while the deeper soil where the roots are may be still soaked. When my moisture meter arrived I had spent a few days being tempted to water my dumb cane even though it wasn\u2019t asking for water. I had received it from a friend like 3 weeks prior and I thought \u201cit must be needing water by now!\u201d But little did I know the deeper soil was still heavily moist. The pot has drainage but this is how I received it, so I left it alone and a couple of weeks later it\u2019s still mildly moist! I would have never been able to tell without this wise little device. It\u2019s definitely a game changer. I have a big fern in a big pot and this helps me determine if it needs water or not just great! My green-thumb friend suggested I created a schedule to water all my plants (like water them all on the 15th of the month, or the first) but I was conflicted about that. Now I know exactly when each plant needs a good drink or when I should leave it alone. Leaving it alone is the hardest part because when I started getting plants I had this disney-movie idea that I\u2019d wake up in the morning, feed the birds and water the plants...the birds are fine, the plants? Not so much. Overwatering is how most people kill plants. Thanks to the moisture meter I can actually stop myself! It is completely accurate. I was glad I read the reviews, as most of the negative reviews say they tested in water and it didn\u2019t work so \u201cit must be broken\u201d. No, it\u2019s not, the device is specifically designed to be used in a dense soil and not to test in water. It doesn\u2019t even work on orchids mix because it\u2019s too chunky and there\u2019s too many open / airy gaps in it. But all the other soil, potting mix, cactus mix etc it works perfectly fine. I highly recommend to anyone who wishes to get better at plant parenthood! I even got one for my friend who has an amazing green thumb because she was very impressed with it and told me she had a couple of plants she always had to guess about! I have about 20 plants in my home and they are all happy and thriving! If you have plants, get a moisture meter now!", "I absolutely love this moisture meter. Especially for my succulents in non draining pots. It's exactly what I needed.", "\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffdSo I have had this for months. But I have been watching to see if it actually works. I don\u2019t like to rely on it solely so I always use my finger to test the soil also. Anyways, recently I noticed that on plants, that I can 100% feel their wet soil, it detects DRY. Which is crucial because if I was just going by the meter, my indoor plants would be dead. I have ALOT of expensive beautiful plants and I got the meter because I wanted to take as best care as possible of them. So this product let me down. It wasn\u2019t just for me, it was for when I went out of town and needed someone to help me take care of my plants and not kill them lolNow I can\u2019t return it because it\u2019s been too long. But atleast I can 100% tell you that this is NOT reliable and you should buy a better one or just use your finger!", "Love this. Tells me, instantly, whether my plants need water.  I love houseplants and have about 20, but some just don't seem to be happy no matter what I do.  With this meter, I'm learning that though the top of the soil looks moist, just beneath the surface it's very dry--no wonder the plants are struggling.  I've been using for about a week now and have started to learn which plants need daily watering, which can go longer in between.  Expecting happier, healthy plants!  (Very easy to use, just stick it in the dirt and the dial instantly tells you whether the soil is dry, moist or wet.  Remove and go to the next plant.  Easy!  I'm ordering another so that I won't have to take back and forth between my plant areas.", "Tried this in all my plants, some of which I knew were dry and some of which were definitely moist, and the needle was always at 1. When I put it in a slightly moist plant, it twitched up to 2, and I thought maybe it would adjust properly, but it just stayed there (and I know that plant was higher than a 2). Then I thought maybe my plants really WERE all way drier than I thought, so I watered one heavily  and tried it again. The needle moved up to a 3--so it moved, but still thought the soil was dry, when it was in fact saturated. I tried all the things to make it work--wiped off the tip, gave it a few minutes to calibrate in each plant, did not stick it in a glass of water, etc. It's just not sensitive enough. If I followed these meter I would be drowning all my plants.", "Very easy to use and read. With this meterI can easily know whether the plants grow in the most suitable environment. If not, I can do certain adjustment. Very Helpful. Will keep tracking how it works.18-month replacement warranty! Very good service considering the price.", "I have around 70 houseplants and TONS of potted plants outside. I am a long time gardener and plant lover. This is a total piece of junk. Tried it in three separate plants I had just watered thoroughly. Read dry every time. Returned. Do not see the need to keep wasting my time with this product.  I did NOT stick it in a glass of water which you are warned not to. I FIRMLY believe in checking the soil for moisture with the good old \"finger\" test. It works every time. Yes, you can lift a pot you are used to and tell fairly well if it feels very light, but you have to know what it feels like when it is not needing water. if you are good at reading plants, some will let you know by a little wilting that you have gone too far without watering. I don't like to let them get that far if I can avoid it. I wonder if some of us who have experienced the total failure of this product have received one which someone sent back after ruining by sticking in the water? Possibly? But after this experience, I'll stick with the finger test and not bother. I didn't like the way you are pushing it down into the plants roots as well, and possibly disturbing or breaking some of them.", "Great product.  I used to stick my finger in the pot to test moisture content, but this is so much better.  In addition, I also use it outside for in-ground plants.  My only gripe is that the tip keeps pulling off.  It will eventually pull off into the dirt and I will lose it.UPDATE (18 days after receipt):  Do not buy this product.  My gripe above materialized only 18 days after I received this item.  The tip just came off in a plant while I was testing for moisture.  I dug in the plant for about 10 minutes looking for the tip, but it is gone.  *** WASTE OF MONEY *** If you want to waste money by purchasing this product, send it to me instead.", "I have cacti and succulents in a medium that is half pumice, half commercial succulent mix. Very gritty. This reads dry even after watering. I'm not sure if the mixture I use just doesn't conduct properly for this sensor, or if it is defective.  It does move a bit within the \"dry\" range but not enough to be useful.  I also don't like that I am probably damaging roots each time I test, but that is the nature of this type of sensor and not this model in particular.", "I first bought a moisture meter at Pike's Nursery.  It is battery operated and it is very difficult to read when placing it in the potted plant especially one that sits on the floor.  Then I looked on Amazon and found this one. It is exactly like the one I previously had that lasted about 10 years.  It is easy to read and doesn't require batteries.  I love it.", "I bought this because my house is hectic and thought it could help me keep up with my plants. This worked for about a week then would always say \u201cdry\u201d. I killed a few plants because they were overwatered because of this thing! I submerged the stem in a cup of water and it still reads \u201cdry\u201d after an hour. Don\u2019t waste your money. I\u2019ve started to set reminders on my phone and check moisture  with a dry chopstick.", "I bought this according to all the great reviews - but I almost killed my plants. Before i decided to try this I was watering based on weight of the pot and sticking my finger in to see if it was dry - I thought this was going to be more scientific since a few of my plants were in a  'wallygrow' pot and they are mounted on a wall and hard to assess the weight method. The meter was reading moist to wet every time i went to water so I didn't water the plants - this went on for a few weeks and I became suspicious especially because the plants were browning and looking like they were dying. I went back to my old method and they seem to be doing fine now. I'm unsure if I got a defective one or if it's a piece of junk. But - just wanted to warn others.", "All these brands must be made in the exact same factory with the cheapest available materials possible. Look at those 3 different \"brands\"...they are all the same, the one with 2 probes is different, but only because it has that additional pH probe(that also is terribly inaccurate).One thing that stood out for this product was somehow it had a very caustic chemical spilled all over the packaging. Fortunately it wasn't coming from thus product itself, and the plastic bag inside the box protected this incredibly cheap product that doesn't work.Out of the 3 moisture meters I tested this one was by far the least accurate. It said one of my planters was bone dry, so I purposely added a ton of water, enough to 100% saturate the soil and also leak out of the bottom. After this, this meters reading was a 4/10...barely in the \"moist\" range. Can't get any more wet that that.To be fair all of these were so cheaply made, probably the same factory, it may be a roll of the dice in terms of which brand is better than the others, I'd guess that there's a lot of variation in accuracy withing the same brand, and this one just by chance was the worst. Look elsewhere!", "As soon as it arrived I tried this XLUX moisture meter and as the photos show, every single potted plants I tested show the soil as bone try, which they are most definitely not.The Sansevieria was thoroughly watered 2 days ago; the Agloanema was thoroughly watered 5 days ago;; the Haworthia was thoroughly watered 5 minutes ago (before tested with the meter); and the African violet is in a self-watering pot so the soil is always moist.  All the hassle got me a defective product, what are the odds?I am getting a replacement from Amazon but it will take another 20 days to arrive.  I really, really need it as my  Calatheas are not doing well at all and I was hoping this will help with the watering schedule.  This appears to be the best reviewed of the moister meter (at this price range) so I hope the replacement works.  Will report back.[UPDATE]  Well, the replacement came in a week, so kudos to Amazon.  However, it is defective as well, every pots are shown as 1 (bone dry) and they are not .  To make a final verdict, I set up a small pot with fresh potting mix, drenched it in water and tested it.  The dial finally moved, to 3/4, the mix is sopping wet.  I returned it again.  No more with this brand.  Hope I've better luck with another brand.", "Either the meter I received was defective, or this is generally a poor product. I tested it across multiple different pots of soil, which I had added different amounts of water to. I could feel the different moisture levels with my fingers, which is how I typically test my soil, but I'm tired of getting my hands dirty. I rinsed and dried it between pots. It read multiple pots of moist soil as \"dry\", and read some of the VERY wet pots as only \"moist\". I would severely overwater my plants if I relied on this device.", "Does not work. It says all my plants are a \u201c1\u201d (dry as can be)... even if I just watered them and the soil is soaked. Can\u2019t believe I wasted my money on this.", "Don't waste your money.  I was so excited to get this as I am really getting into succulents and thought it would be awesome to really know when they need water.  BUT, from the very first time I used it the dial didn't register anything.  ???  It was either sent broken, I got a bad one, or the darn thing doesn't work.  VERY disappointed.", "I love this soil moisture meter. It's easy to use and read, especially if you have big and deep planters. No more guessing, just stick this into the pot 2/3 deep. I tend to overwater my plants so this item helps a lot. Thanks. One negative thing is don't believe the plant list on the package because dumbcane and dieffenbachia are the same plant but listed on red zone and green zone. Sanseviera aka snake plants are on green zone that's supposed to be on red zone (don't need a lot of water). So use your own judgment.UPDATED: I found another flaw on this meter. It can't detect moisture for soil mixed with 30+% pumice. The reading is always dry even the top soil is still moist. So I reduced the rating from 5 to 3 stars.", "I bought this moisture meter knowing the risk that I could get a defective unit after reading reviews. I am glad to say it works, but I have reservations about accuracy and long term life. See below.So, literally, I have only had this for less than 24hrs and within the first minutes of using the meter I thought I had a defective unit. I went to my one Schefflera, and tested the soil. It read in the red \u201cdry\u201d zone. I was puzzled as I thought it should read moist or wet.So... like other reviews I grabbed a tall glass of water, and submerged the probe. Sure enough it only read in the dry category. At this point I was like \u201cgreat, I\u2019m sending this junk back\u201d. Yet, I took the time to just toy around with the unit and very gently tapped the plastic head containing the meter, and I also took a soft cloth to the metal probe and cleaned it a couple times. either by coincidence or those methods helping the probe, it then started to read \u201c10 wet\u201d when putting the probe in a glass of water.At this point I went back to the Schefflera and it read \u201cbetween 3 and 4 moist\u201d, African violet 3 moist, my one echeveria succulent 2 dry, the money tree was at a \u201c5 moist\u201d, and a few others read in the \u201cmoist zone\u201d.I then watered the Money tree as an experiment, and sure enough right after watering and probing different parts of the soil it registered \u201c10 wet\u201d. Back in the glass of water it also registered \u201c10 wet\u201d.So at this juncture, I believe the meter works and is accurate. I debated giving 3 or 4 stars as I had to actually monkey around with the meter to turn it from a \u201cdefective unit\u201d to actually working. So at this time I will give it 4 stars due to initial use, but worry it will stop working again, and honestly I don\u2019t know how durable it will be.In my eyes this meter will help give me a decent starting point but this meter won\u2019t be the \u201claw of the land\u201d. I cannot fully trust it due to very first incident, but I believe it to have potential.", "This item is the biggest piece of garbage ever put on the market. Unless you're sticking it into soft sand, it is a bunch of b*******. I bought this not even two weeks ago, and the first one is already broken. I stuck it into a plant and the tip broke right off. at 10 bucks a shot, this should be a much more sturdy product. I have purchased several over the past several months and they're all the same.", "These work off a chemical reaction between the tip and the shaft. If the soil is too rocky (or anything else causing voids) the tip won't make contact with the same bit of soil as the shaft. This is also why they don't want you to leave it in the soil, it will degrade the tip and cause the unit to read less accurately.The only real remedy you have if this unit stops reading correctly is to polish the tip up with an Emory board or something. It should read like new again after that. Unless you drop it a lot. That analog gauge is sensitive.", "I LOVE IT! I never new this was available! It helps me check the moisture in the plants soil with ease.  Before this tool I would forget to water my plants and water them when I noticed they're wilting or almost near dead. Now I make my rounds indoor and out, checking each plants moisture status, pretty much every other day or couple of days. I actually seen the difference after one week, plants are ACTUALLY surviving in my care now! They are so perky, and growing.  There's a ledger on the box that has plant names with a number that the moisture should be at. I follow that ledger level and it hasn't failed me. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this product!! Worth the money and no maintenance needed (other than wiping the probe). It makes caring for your plants TOO EASY.  As you can see, I've overwatered one of my bromeliads... so I will make sure not to water that one when I water the others. Also, I use fertilizer to keep my babies happy and healthy.  So it's not Just the meter that keeps them looking great, they do need nutrients. All these pictures were taken at the same time. I just insert it in one plant pot, pull out,  wipe and insert into another pot,  EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEEZY!!", "I was very excited about this moisture meter. I had a feeling that we were overwatering some of our plants, and this tool proved my suspicion.What makes me mad is how quickly it broke. I used it about a dozen times and by that I mean, it has gone into soil about a dozen times. The tip that actually measures the moisture snapped and was left in the soil. This is an extremely poorly and cheaply made item to snap so easily. It has only been used in potted plants with pretty wet soil. I'm 5 days past the return window when this happened so I am out of luck.My suggestion is to look elsewhere for something a bit more sturdy.These moisture meters are great, if they last. It will save your plants from being overwatered, and you from wasting water, especially in this time of a historic drought here in California.I'm deeply disappointed that this item broke so quickly. Not recommended at all if you're looking for longevity.", "Update: The seller\u2019s response time was notable and they instructed me to return the defective meter via Amazon\u2019s return service and said they\u2019d send me a replacement. The replacement arrived today and seems to be in working order but it is inaccurate. It errors on the side of too dry which, for me, is unacceptable because I keep succulents and other plants that are very intolerant of overwatering, which this meter would have me do. So about two weeks were spent only to end up with two meters I can\u2019t use.I got a different meter on Amazon (Gouevn) that I like better and seems way more accurate.The plant in the picture was watered recently so it wasn\u2019t soaked but it was NOT dry either. It was moist. I think I know which meter I will be keeping.Original review:I was super excited to get this meter because I just started keeping succulents and I tent to ever water. When this arrived, I stuck it in one of my house plants and it read \u201cDry 1.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t that dry because I had watered earlier this morning. I tried on several other plants with varying dryness/wetness levels and it continued to read \u201cDry 1.\u201d very disappointed. I contacted the seller and will update my review if/when the issue is resolved.", "This moisture meter is extremely inaccurate and could leave you with root rot/dead plants. I have two hibiscus plants that like to be kept moist, so I water them often, but this meter has read \u201cdry\u201d even after I watered the same day. Extremely inaccurate and cannot be trusted.", "I got this and immediately tested it out. Every single one of my plants showed \"dry\". I have around 50 house plants and succulents! I had a pot with just soil in it that I had recently removed a plant from, so I decided to thoroughly saturate the soil... like way beyond a healthy amount of water for a plant... just to test the meter to see if something was wrong with it. It moved maybe to a \"3\" on the scale, still in the dry range. This was regular potting soil. There is no way on earth that it was \"dry\". It should have registered closer to a 10! Don't waste your money on this. Sticking your finger in the soil to test it would be 100 times more accurate.", "First off, let me just say I've read many of the reviews (positive and negative). I've also read the instructions and I'm not a dummy. I haven't used the product improperly and I kind of think maybe I just received one with a damaged sensor? I tried testing it in lightly moist sphagnum moss, houseplants I recently watered and are damp to the touch, etc. and the meter won't rise above a 2 in any situation. It just didn't work, idk why. I've seen YouTube videos and Instagram stories where it worked just fine so maybe I was just unlucky.", "Where I live we have very pure water. If I stick the meter in a glass of water, it only reads \"moist\" If I add a pinch of salt in the glass the needle pegs on \"wet\". The reading depends more on soil salinity than moisture. All gauges of this type measure electrical potential between two types of metal in the tip of the sensor. This makes them very sensitive to dissolved salts (which include fertilizers) even more than moisture. If I wanted to track the offset between the actual moisture fluctuations in each pot relative to the meter reading, I could back calculate actual moisture in each pot... if I cared to track the correction factor for each pot and plot of soil in my yard. I'm pretty disappointed. Do research before you buy. This is a well documented problem with this type of sensor and not limited to this brand.", "My first one lasted a couple of months before it stopped working... I got a second and within less than a month it stopped working well. It was really helpful when it did work but I'm surprised by how easily it breaks/ dies...Going to try out another brand.", "Updates 07/24/21: Ignore my previous review.  I've had this meter for less than a month and the end just broke off leaving it useless.  I still like the concept of a moisture meter but this one is a complete waste of money.  Get a different brand.After retiring and starting to putz around the yard and garden, I thought I'd check out this moisture meter.  I couldn't figure out why many of my potted plants and flowers were dying. Well, even though the soil appeared to be dry this meter quickly showed there was sufficient moisture.  I now test every potted plant and my garden before watering.  No more over watering.  Quick, simple and easy to read.", "I received this on time, but it seems to be broken or defective, or maybe it never worked in the first place. I tried it immediately and the arrow didn't move at all. I thought maybe all my plants were dry so the next morning I watered them and a few hours later tried to measure again. The arrow didn't move, even after I left it for over half an hour in the soil. Will be returning, hoping for a refund. Waste of money, I feel cheated.", "Don't waste your money.  To test the devise I used it on a plant I watered the day before. Soil surface was moist to the touch!The meter moved to 2 in the red zone and didn't change after 15 minutes.  According to that reading cactus needed to be wstered.When I removed the meter and wiped the soil off with my fingers my fingers were DAMP!!!  If you have moisture sensitive plants you will kill them if you rely on this meter.", "This was the first water meter I bought. I have become a plant parent via the pandemic and started collecting a variety. With so many varying watering preferences I thought have a meter to make sure a plant was dry enough to water would help me with consistency. And I thought it was working. But I decided to buy the Sonkir Soil pH Meter, MS02 3-in-1 Soil Moisture/Light/pH Tester Gardening Tool since it also has a light meter and would help make sure my plants were in adequate locations for the preferred sun exposure. I have the Sonkir and XLUX in my Money Tree. As you can see the XLUX say dry (the needle didn't even move) and the Sonkir says moist. I trust the Sonkir because the needle does move when inserted so I know it's actually measuring. And I just watered the plant today so there is no reason it should be dry. I also included a photo of a different Sonkir device in a different plant. The meter reading is slightly different so clearly accurate.", "I liked the concept. I wanted it for my worm compost bin to check moisture level.  I tried it in my bin, in a moist recently watered plant, in a dry - hasn't been watered in several weeks.....and what do ya know. They all register the same.  In the dry area. I tested over several days, several diffrent situations and this thing is worthless. Sorry seller, but your item truely doesn't work.I don't usually leave bad reviews, most of the time I can find something useful about the product, but that isn't the case here, don't waste your money.", "I initially got this to help me out with some succulents I purchased.  Unfortunately, the planting mix I was using is far too rocky for this to work for those.  If your mix is very rocky, I don't think soil meters are going to work for you.However, I started using this in my other houseplants and there has been a noticeable difference in how my plants look after a short time of use.  It has helped me determine a better watering schedule for all my plants, and that some of my pots were not draining.  If you are new to houseplants, or you have some houseplants that you are having trouble with, I would definitely recommend this product.", "I am not a review writer but I had to come on and let everyone know how amazing this is. Like most during quarantine I picked up a plant habit. But didn\u2019t quite understand \u201cjust stick your finger in the dirt and you\u2019ll know when to water it\u201d.

I went to return this on Amazon and they quickly resolved my issues. Very happy with their customer service.I am writing this review as just an FYI. Seeing the review pictures I thought the 'base', the green section, would be a bit smaller. In my photo you can see this compared to my fist. It is just bigger than I thought for a small pot. If you are looking for a small one, this may not be the best size for you.However, I will certainly go through this seller again due to their support! With the amazing reviews, I trust I just got a bad one. Happens with every company occasionally :)", "I'm really liking this moisture sensor. I've had some plants in the garden that were struggling, and I thought they needed more water, since it was over 100 degrees. But this helped me see I was overwatering (I guess the mulch was really holding water in better than I thought). After cutting back on the water, my squash and cucumbers are rebounding and looking greener and healthier. I do think, though, that it's not a great sensor for potted plants. It almost always thinks they're dry, even when the soil is moist on top. I think the soil is too airy, so it seems dry to this sensor. Also, the head is starting to wiggle just a bit, so I need to be careful not to break it by pushing it too hard in heavy soil.", "I cleaned off the tip  and stuck the reader down to the roots, as mentioned in the brief instructions. Immediately, there was no change in reading (it was stuck in the dry end) and after waiting for 10 minutes, there was still no change from dry. As a result, I assumed my soil was dry and watered my plants. I am new to being a plant parent and so I only have two, one of which began dying (leaves wilting and turning brown), within the next few days. I checked the status of the soil again, after this began and still it stated that my soil was dry. I'm very unhappy with this product because I lost an $80+ plant due to this cheap product.", "This is a miracle gadget that saved all of my houseplants from drowning and frying. It is easy to use as long as you understand how it works and do research on each plant. Read the box! Don't do anything stupid like testing it on hard ground or in a glass of water. Just gingerly poke it into the soil to the depth you want... an inch or two, or to root depth. If there is root resistance, change position. This is where research comes into picture. Most plants like to dry out a lot; some like their soil to be moist but not wet. Plants in smaller or terracotta pots dry out faster. I don't water my succulents unless they're in the 0-2 zone towards the bottom of the pot. I keep my spider plant happy in a ceramic pot and watering around 3-5 (or when it droops and the soil feels dry). My point is, pay attention to the culture! Wrong light and overwatering kills most plants. You can't go wrong with bright indirect light and this magic wand. I just wipe it with a Kleenex in between measurements. It reads moisture instantly by the way. Even though I am much more experienced now, I still like to use the meter. Its proof is in the dozens of healthy plants I have.", "Simplicity is important and this does just what it's supposed to!  There are some meters that tell you how much light it's getting but anyone with eyes doesn't need a meter to tell them that!  This has been especially useful for making sure my finicky fiddle leaf fig doesn't have an excuse to die on me. :)  It's also been nice for my birds nest fern, which likes to be dry halfway down before getting watered again, but because it takes up most of it's pot, it would be impossible for me to get my fingers down that far in the soil to tell otherwise.It's not perfect, because it operates on electrical conductivity, so if you have too many salts in your soil that can throw it off, but it's a great tool to use in conjunction with your common sense!", "AFTER A YEAR:  I had to get used to the fact that the soil consistency makes a difference as to how this measures moisture. In a sandy or coarse mix it won't detect the moisture as well so I take that into consideration. However, it has saved a few of my plants. I have an indoor tree in a very large pot that always seemed dry just from looking at the surface soil so I was always over-watering it.  With this moisture sensor I now discover it's been waterlogged down about 2 inches. No wonder it was dying. Now that I'm not over-watering it's doing much better.AFTER A FEW WEEKS: It's hard to tell if it's working as it should since my only way to check it is by sticking my finger in the soil .. but I think it works just fine! I use it on all my house plants because I don't want to over water.", "I highly recommend these moisture meters. I have three stashed around my home. I purchased each one from a different seller and they're consistent in quality. It absolutely works. It makes quick work of checking on your houseplants. It's cleaner too. Initially, I was very sceptical until I saw a respected, professional gardener using one. Go for it! You won't be disappointed.Additionally, it doesn't work in a glass of water. I tried this and thought it didn't work. I did a little research and learned it needs to be soil. It has something to do with the soil resistance and/or conductivity.", "I purchased this soil moisture test in April.  I used it about 5 or 6 times.  It worked great in letting me know if the ground beneath my trees was wet or dry.  I always used a screwdriver first to make a hole about 8\" deep.  I then put the tester in that hole.Today, when I pulled the tester out, the sensor on the end dislodged.  No way to find it. That is very disappointing and of course, it is past the return date.I do not recommend this brand.  I will try to find a more reliable brand.", "I was looking for an easy way to tell what was going on under the soil and learn how to water my plants correctly.  The top review is well written and correct.  There is some allusion in the write up to the fact this is not a stick it in, expect accuracy, and just water as needed.  I'm sure agrarian-types find this tool a phenomenon.  Me... the average \"add water to seeds in milk carton\" level of experience, this has no real use for me.  I was surprised by instructions... a wee more complicated than expected.  Wipe tip with rough paper... stick it in.  But not more than an hour.  But how do I know how much water to add... that was my main conundrum.  But this does not provide the magic answer.  I couldn't even get a normal read, as differences in the same pot were significantly different.  Then... oops, did I just add water while it was in soil?  Oh no, did I break it now?  A moisture reader you can't get \"wet.\"  All the plants listed on the box of course matched zero plants I'm growing.  The bottom line is, you're just measuring, and not so accurately.  What does the information mean?  It doesn't tell me how much water to add.  Wasted money for me.  I just don't see the point for houseplants.  But I'm sure there are green thumbs I've enraged already by not knowing how to use this tool \"correctly\" or what I was getting into.  It's not the water babysitter and teacher the layman may assume.  Frankly, what is the need after you stick it in?  You'd have to know just what to add, and don't you know anyway?  Not for me.", "I don't know why this meter gets good reviews my soil was very damp and it reads dry just like the other junk meters.", "I heard about these moisture meters on one of the youtube channels I watch, and decided that for $12 its worth giving it a try. Up until buying this, I had been sticking my finger into the soil to see if it is wet or dry. (I still do that with some of my smaller plants.) But for larger plants, this item is a game changer for me. I like to let 99% of my plants dry out completely before watering them, and this meter has helped me do that. It is, however, not completely fool proof. For example, I think it is important to put this moisture meter into several different spots in one plant pot, so that you get an accurate representation of how wet or dry the soil is. So, if you only put this into the outer rim of soil on a larger plant then you might assume the whole pot is dry, when the middle might still be wet. As long as you understand this and be sure to take several different readings for those larger pots, you should be fine. \ud83d\ude42 The only problem that I can see in using this is that if you have a pest in one plant, and you go sticking this meter into all of your plants, you could quickly end up with an infestation of your entire collection! To combat this, I am using Bonide Systemic granules for houseplants and Captain Jacks Dead Bug Brew spray as preventative measures. In my opinion, it's important to stay ahead of pest issues, especially if you have one item that you are using in each plant such as this.", "Unfortunately, neither of these sensors work. Watered one of my houseplants and let the soil get completely saturated. Then I tested the stick and it said dry. Like, bone dry. Stuck them in a dry plant and, yeah, it said dry still, but then I filled up a glass of water and put the sticks in - nada. Said it was dry. Very disappointed.", "What a great tool for us over and under-waterers. I bought two snake plants and have two dumb canes  that where\u2019re looking too well. I needed up with root rot over watering my snake.  I received the meter and it read my reported snake was bone dry. It read my reported dumb canes were bone dry. I was concerned the meter didn\u2019t work. Then I tested my 2nd snake plant and read moist to wet.  This was crazy since I bottom watered a week ago. My soil and pot was retaining the water.Then I went and watered my 1st snake plant and my two canes. Went back and used the meter and voila- the soil was moist.This little tool is not only fun but precise. I hope it still works after my child decided to stick it in my pot for a day*smh*", "This is the WORST moisture meter I have EVER owned! I wanted a one probe meter as I have 2 two probe meters already. One is 20 years old and is as accurate as the first day I bought it! I followed the instructions to the *T\" and it STILL read DRY even though my plants were just watered. The dry ones read DRY and the wet ones read DRY! And what was so HUMILIATING was I took it with me to our Senior Center Plant Club. Everybody was so EXCITED when they saw I had a \"new\" meter and gathered around to see how it worked. I tested my plants first... nothing. The instructor suggested testing it on other plants... NOTHING! THESE SOIL METERS ARE GARBAGE and you know it but you keep selling them...and of all places on AMAZON! You sell a lot of these because of the cheap price! We also understand WHY you have so many 5 stars...it's easy to PAY people to sit there and make them up! You don't have as many 1 stars because people find out they're JUNK and toss them in the TRASH rather than bothering with trying to send them back and writing an HONEST REVIEW like mine!", "Love this XLUX T10 Soil Moisture Sensor Meter - Soil...Purchased one several months ago and loved it..Gave that one to my step-daughter and purchased a second one. Suspect my plant love it too as the meter tells me just how dry the soil is or how wet it is and I know when to water them!", "Worked fine right out of the box. Grabbed it today (6 weeks later per my order history) and noticed everything was reading dry-dry-dry, even the indoor plants I watered a few days ago. Weird. So I watered everything again and decided to stick it in. Every pot kept reading dry. Waited 15-20 minutes thinking the water just needed to soak into the soil and took the time to water all my patio plants. Rechecked and everything kept reading dry. Decided to soak my outside monstera\u2026. And it still read dry. Ended up sticking it into the watering can itself, and once again: DRY. So, less than two months later, junk.", "I am extremely disappointed in this product.  My indoor basii plants thrived prior to my buying the meter.  After my first purchase of this meter, I replaced it with a 2nd one, thinking that I just had a bad moisture meter.  However, the 2nd one was even worse!  It kept registering 'Dry' so I kept adding water....but it never went past \"Dry'!  Then the plants starting dying due to the overwatering caused by the moisture meter telling me that their soil was \"DRY\".  I then tested the meter  by placing it in a glass of water....and even after five minutes in the glass of water, it still registered \"DRY.\"", "I just tested this on all my raised beds, as well as various veggies in my greenhouse.  This thing is very accurate.Sticking a finger in an inch or so in the soil will tell you if you need water in that inch or so, but this tester gets deeper into the root zone, and that\u2019s where you want to know the moisture content.I tested potted veggies that I knew to be dry, and the tester tested dry.  Then I tested plants that I knew for certain didn\u2019t need water, and the tester agreed on each plant.No batteries required, either.But ... be sure to follow the directions.  Do NOT immerse in water, and also, to get an accurate measure,m be sure you stick the probe down to the root zone (or your best guess of its location).  Lastly, don\u2019t force it in if your soil is rocky or very hard (pure, dry clay, for instance).  And wipe it clean after each time you stick into the soil.  I carried a paper towel for this.  Wipe clean when done.", "We just re-landscaped our old overgrown yard. The soil was very dry from not having any sod or plants in it for several weeks, so we've been pouring water on the new plants. They kept wilting. We kept watering.Our landscape designer suggested we order a moisture meter. That's when we discovered we were OVER watering. So now, we check moisture levels before turning on the hose. This simple device may have saved us from needing to replace a lot of plants. Works indoors too.Note that the meter will only work in SOIL. It will not read in plain water, gritty/sandy/rocky succulent mix or small bark used for orchids.", "Immediately began using it right from the bag, I have stepped up my patio plants into the pricey range, and wanted to be absolutely sure I was giving them the proper water as over watering can kill some of them and not enough same boat.  As I had several plants it was no problem to determine if the thing was just giving me a reading and not accurate.  I stuck it first into ones I could tell with a finger stick they were moderate in water, that is what the meter read, then I stuck it in a pot that I had let dry out waiting for my little  water gauge to arrive, it read dry.  I didn't have anything overwatered so I didn't test that one.  But based on gauge movement on the other plants and knowing their status read correctly I believe the high wet reading will work if you are new to plants and get one over watered.  It only took moments for  the reading to show.  A quick wipe of probe and on to next plant.  Very easy to read can't ask for anything else except for it to continue being a reliable way to read water levels.", "This product did not work. Watered my plants night 1, meter read dry. Tested it day 2 meter read dry. Tested day 4.. meter read dry. Tried it on the soil of all my plants, different soil mix\u2019s. One time I got it the dial to move by lifting it up and down in the soil in the same spot... still read as dry. Not sure if it was defective or just a bad product. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.", "I took a Zoom class from my county extension service on edible landscaping. The first thing they said that the most common mistakes people make are planting too closely and overwatering. Last year I bought one of these so that I knew when my plants were actually in need of water, especially the potted fruit trees. It worked really well. The color coded dial shows how moist the soil is.I use it most every day, unless it rains.The box has an extensive list of houseplants and when each needs waterLast month the sensor died. Just stopped working. I was in the warranty period so I contacted the company and 5 days later I had a new and improved sensor. I use it every day still.", "I have another one, but misplaced it, and it works perfectly.  I thought I lost it, so ordered another one just like it.  Well, it registered DRY on the first 4 plants I tried it out on, and they are very moist.  Finally, on the 5th plant, the meter registered slightly moist.Many people told me they lost plants because their meters were inaccurate, but I guess my first one was an exception because it worked.My advice is don\u2019t order this because some work and some don\u2019t.  (I did find my original working meter).", "I think I got a dud. My meter never moved past the \"dry\" spot. I thoroughly watered my plants and immediately started testing. The meter said dry. Then I waited a few minutes and tried again.. same thing. I waited an hour or two and tried again... notta. I tried for giggles the next day and it said my very wet plant was dry. I gave up and returned the product. However, when I first ordered it, I told my friend about my purchase. She bought one shortly after and hasn't had any issues with hers. I know it's only $10, but I expected mine to work for a least a short amount of time.", "I wondered how well this would work, and really didn't expect it to work well.  Well, it works fine.  You do have to follow the directions.  Basically, you stick it into the soil, and wiggle it around a bit while watching for the meter to jump up.  When it does, you look at the reading.  Then you remove it and wipe the probe clean.  Following these directions, it reads nearly the same as the digital meter that I bought.What won't work is leaving it in the soil.  That won't lead to any sort of accurate meeting, and it'll damage the meter.  You also can't check it by putting it in water.  This isn't a humidity meter.  This meter works on the electrical potential developed by having two different metals in contact with the moist soil.  No idea how that can read moisture accurately, but it does.", "I have between 20-25 indoor plants on several tables & a bookcase on my one wall in my front room. Because I don't get much light I purchased growing lights which I have shining for up to 12 hours daily on my plants. I have 12 grow lights to make sure every one of them gets a good amount of light. But I had a really hard time with knowing when to water & when not to water. Then I found this tool and I have got to tell you that it has helped tremendously!!! Just stick it into the soil and it gives you a reading as to whether I should water or just leave it alone with no water. I believe this tool, with the grow lights, has made all the difference in the world! I don't have to guess whether or not the roots are getting enough water. Now I know. You will not be disappointed buying this tool. AAA+++........", "I use this meter to check the moisture content of the soil in my lawn. I've been very happy with it and feel that it is quite accurate, however, the package does not let you know what the ideal reading is for a lawn. The device reads 1-10, and the numbers are in different zones. For example, 1-3 are dry, 4-7 are moist, and 8-10 are wet. The box tells you which general zone (dry, moist, wet) different plants should be in, but it doesn't include lawns. I would even like to know the exact target number for my particular grass seed. I assume it should be in the \"moist\" or \"wet\" zones, but considering that is 4-10, I'd like a better idea of what my target # should be. With that said, I am still happy with the purchase. As long as I hit the \"moist zone\", my lawn looks healthy. I also like that I can test it at different depths.If the manufacturer of this product is reading the review, please add different grass varieties to the watering guide on the back of the box. Even a generic \"lawn\" category would be helpful. It would be cool if you broke it down even further (perhaps on a website) and gave the exact # we should be shooting for. The ranges are good, but an exact # would be ideal.Update: I just attached a picture of my lawn. It is currently green while most in my neighborhood are drought stressed. Using this device, I have been able to quickly ascertain which areas need water. My neighbor had patches of grass that looked dead or dormant. I plunged this into it, and it was completely dry. The green section next to it registered moist. The issue was that his sprinkler heads weren\u2019t adequately distributing the water.", "I bought this to help me care for my succulents. I tested it out first by watering a non-succulent plant thoroughly and then testing the soil after it drained a little. It said the soil was bone dry. If I use this on my succulents and it says the soil is dry when it isn't, I could end up overwatering. Not cool.", "I'm not the best at being able to determine what my plants are telling me and usually have a heavy hand with water, so I thought this moisture meter would be perfect to help me determine when to water my plants. Unfortunately the numbers are completely random. I have included a video where I reinsert the device into the soil multiple times, which resulted in several different readings. This indicates that the one I received is inaccurate and faulty. I will update my review accordingly once I've tested a replacement.", "4/15/21 I kept trying the meter to see if I could get different readings and depending on how deep I put it in the reading was a bit different.  I changed my initial rating from 2 stars to 4 but I will still be returning to see if I can find something a bit more reliable.4/14/21 I watered my plants yesterday and received my Moisture Meter today so I decided to test my soil.  The meter never left the dry setting except slightly on one of the plants.  I decided to water again today thinking maybe the plants were extra dry when I watered them yesterday but the meter never left the red area even after soaking the plants.  I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, it seems so easy to use, so I'm assuming the item is defective in some way.", "We've had a lot of rain lately, but you can't always tell if the soil is still moist a few days later, especially if it's been hot and the top of the soil is dry. This has a nice long probe so you can down six inches or so to tell whether you actually need to water or not. The dial is so easy to read; no squinting needed, even when you're looking at it from above. It also comes with a list of plants and which like to be quite wet, which like moderate moisture, and which like drier soil. Finally, read the instructions. You must rub the tip with a paper towel before every use to remove oxide (which can't be seen), so you continue to get an accurate reading. My plants are so much happier now -- and I'm saving water because I'm not watering \"just in case.\" I know which plants need water and how much.", "I'm not sure if mine is broken or what but reading this thing is confusing. When I insert it into the soil it quickly shoots up to maxed out 10 - wet (and even past that!) no matter what the moisture level really is. Then it slowly starts to climb down to either dry or low moist within a minute or two. If I leave it in for 5 minutes it'll finally pick a spot and stay there, usually at the dry (3) or low moist level (4-5).2 and 3 weeks after watering my plants it still stays at wet (maxed out over the 10) when the finger test clearly indicates moist to dry. I've even pulled a plant out of the pot to check the roots because it was indicating it's still wet and the soil was not even close to wet.The only time it doesn't say 10 wet is when it's bone dry and it'll correctly read dry immediately. I would say this is not very accurate or I got a broken device.", "It says everything is dry even after watering my plants. I even waited a few hours and rechecked, and waited til the next day to recheck.. still dry. It has a guide on the back of the box that says what each plant should be at.  Even my BOP that was fully saturated said it was \"dry\". If I gave more water based on this meter I'm afraid I'd end up with root rot. I think I'll just stick to my method of sticking my finger in the soil to check if it needs water.", "I have 13 indoor plants and 5 outdoor plants that I have to keep up with watering, so this makes that task much easier. Rather than trying to water my plants on a schedule which seems to be pretty problematic as I\u2019m a chronic overwaterer, I can now check exactly when they need to be watered. I hate sticking my finger down in the dirt of all of those plants and making a mess along the way, so this is great for a quick check of all plants in one round, just wiping off the probe in between each check. Another added bonus is the list of common plants and the moisture zones on the box! Don\u2019t throw the box out when you get it. I can\u2019t speak to how exactly accurate this is, but it\u2019s definitely more accurate than jamming my finger in the dirt and disturbing my plants and their roots. It checks the depths of the soil more accurately, where it may be hard to feel past the top inch or two with your finger. If you\u2019re worried about the accuracy, just try checking the plant in multiple places and trying to water the plant evenly across all of the soil.", "This product has been working very well for me. I only bought it because I\u2019ve been struggling with a large houseplant in a very large pot. I normally just use my finger to check the soil on my Plants and that\u2019s good enough but this comes handy with Plants in large pots because they take much longer for the soil to dry out in the middle. This sensor is long enough to go down to the middle/bottom of the pot and get a much better reading than my finger would. When I received the sensor, my plant\u2019s soil felt dry on top,(by using my finger) but when I stuck the sensor in twice it read in the middle (Moist), so I knew that it didn\u2019t need to be watered. I\u2019m very happy with this and I\u2019ll be using it regularly! If this review helped you in any way please click on \u2018helpful\u2019 so I know. Feel free to ask questions!", "I live in a studio apt and all of my plants are in a west facing window, which was fine during the summer. When winter hit, I was still watering about the same because the top of the soil was dry. Then some of the leaves started falling off of my plants and I had just purchased a fiddle leaf fig tree. This meter has saved my plants, I was way overwatering thinking they were dry because the topsoil was dry. I didn't want to take a chance of losing my fiddle leaf fig. This meter is so easy to use. On the side of the box, there is a list of plants and the zone number for each plant. When your plant reaches that number on the meter it's time to water. Very happy with my purchase and so are in my plants!", "I really want to love this meter. I've become very interested in succulents and know this will be an invaluable tool...if only it worked properly!  My first one was never off \"dry\", so I exchanged it and this one is never on the driest \"dry\" reading, which is where it should be before it's placed in soil.  Sometimes it's on the third \"dry\" bar, sometimes the first, etc.  It never goes all the way down so I never know what my soil moisture content REALLY is.  That said, it is SO EASY to use. Just place it down deep into the soil and in a matter of seconds, you have your reading.  I WON'T GIVE UP ONIT!!!  Will follow up on number 3 when it arrives.", "I\u2019ve had several different moisture meters over the years but this one is, by far, the best! It measures only moisture (which is fine because I use a soil test for ph) but that\u2019s really all you need. The gauge is large and extremely easy to read. I\u2019ve overwatered before because I couldn\u2019t read the gauge properly or the switch was set to ph (not sure how that happened) so the plant read bone dry when it wasn\u2019t. You will not have those problems with this one. Plus, I looked at 6 different gardening sites and they all placed this meter at the top of their lists for best moisture meter. You simply can\u2019t go wrong with this little gem. Buy it with confidence that it will serve you well. It\u2019s been awesome for me!", "Seems to be accurate based on my knowledge of about how wet various souls I tested are. I wish I had bought a product like this years ago! It is so easy to instantly tell how moist a plant is even six inches deep in the soil. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able to grow succulents now without killing them by watering too soon and too much! I do great with everything else but think this will even improve my other plants.I like this single print model. The double prints won\u2019t work in tiny 2\u201d flower pots. This does.Don\u2019t stick the probe in fluid, only soil or you will ruin it according to directions.I hope this works for a long time!", "This seems to work pretty well in my regular potting soil, however, it will not register at all in my cactus and succulent soil. Which is unfortunate because that is the main reason I bought it, to check the moisture levels in my succulent pots. I'm assuming it's because there are a lot of bits and pieces of drainage materials in there that affect the device's ability to read the moisture levels. Who knows. I know it's not defective because it works fine when I check my foliage plants that are in normal potting soil like my pothos, fittonia, and polka dot plants. So if you're buying this to check your succulents, be warned that if you're using a cactus/succulent/gritty mix, this most likely will not work.", "Meter came with reading already a tad off.  I used it once and it jumped to middle position \"moist\" which made me happy it actually might work.  But, next day it was still on \"moist\".  I then put it into a cup of water and it didn't move at all.  This meter did not work for me, I'm returning it.  It was an Amazon Choice item so I trusted it, but oh well.  I'll look for the next meter once I get credit back.", "This monitor is extremely easy to use and read. I've been a gardener for many years in the Pacific NW but now live in SE Arizona so I'm on a new and steep learning curve. I plant almost all natives to the area so they are all new to me. Water is critical here and although many plants don't need as much water as those I've been used to, they still need to be monitored to make sure I'm not giving them too much or too little. This tool is just a poke in the ground, quick look at the dial, pull out of the soil and wipe off before using on the next plant. Seconds are all in takes but the information is just what I need. I am very happy with this purchase.", "This moisture meter is easy to use - all you need is a paper towel or rag to wipe off the probe between moisture readings.  You need to remember to save the box because printed on the box is the range of acceptable moisture levels for various types of plants.  There are no batteries required (at this time I have not used the meter long enough to know what the battery life is). That would be my only caveat because once the battery dies you need to replace the meter.", "I have purchased a few meters over the years and this is now the one I use most of the time. The Rapitest with cord is good for hard to reach plants but it's hard to read the LCD screen and it uses button cells and you have to fuss with it to use it. The last No battery type I bought was useless to me, I think it was only working intermittently or was just junk. I finally decided to try again and read a LOT of reviews and finally just liked the looks of it. I have 50 plus house plants and they are all sensitive to over or under watering. I think most plants are. Cactus can easily be killed with too much and I can't tell any other way in a crowded pot. Very pleased with the meter. Are they all good, who knows? I should have bought 2.", "I bought this as I'm preparing to travel for work for a couple months and am leaving my significant other in charge of my large and diverse houseplant collection. I figured this way I could use the meter for a couple weeks and find what the readings are when I water each plant and just leave him a list specifying what the reading should be before watering each plant in hopes I won't come home and find all my plants swimming like last time I was away for a month. Not sure how that's going to go, but at least the device works correctly. Also, the probe helps aerate the soil of my plants, which can only help.", "I have close to 60 houseplants. This is such a simple and effective gadget, don\u2019t know how I managed without it - this really prevents me from overwatering (which is one of the worst things you can do to your plants). Just stick the probe into the soil, and it will give a reading immediately on an extremely clear and easy to understand little meter. Before you put it into the soil of your next plant, just wipe the probe with a paper towel (to get rid of any moisture). Conversely, I always find it interesting when I\u2019m convinced my plant\u2019s soil looks super moist, but the meter proves me wrong! If you\u2019re into houseplants, this item really is a no-brainer.... so useful!", "Good grief . . . I do not know what people are expecting from this device but, I have found it to function perfectly fine.  I use it on all of our outdoor plantings (both in-ground as well as small and larger pots).  It is lightweight while being sturdy enough to penetrate mildly firm soil.  For those individuals who place this device directly into water, I suggest they read the instructions where it clearly says not to do this.  In fact, I suggest people read various sources on how to actually use a device like this.  In summary, this device works, is lightweight, sturdy, and an excellent value.", "I should have purchased a meter a long time ago, but was hesitant to do so because of accuracy and quality concerns.  Prior to this purchase, I was just using the finger method, which isn't the best way to ascertain the moisture level of your potting soil, IMHO.  Thus, I took a chance on this meter.This meter allows you to really get a reading from much deeper in your pots, the gauge quickly gives you a reading of the soil's moisture level.  I have approximately 33 houseplants, and I have used the meter on almost all of them the first day.  The meter seems to have given me accurate readings, thus far.I am really pleased so far, and would recommend this product.  Also, it does come with an 18 month warranty.", "I do like this product.  We have several types of plants on our porch.  I would never know if they were adequately watered.  My husband and I would spend time arguing how much water our plants needed.I now use the XLUX soil moisture meter.  No more arguing.  We can tell instantly if the plants are too dry or too wet.Also, we had our front yard landscaped and had a sprinkler system installed that waters each plant.  By using the soil moisture meter we could tell that some  plants were not getting enough water.  We had the landscaper come out and adjust the amount of water each plant received and that solved the problem.  I am sure I would have lost some plants  without having the meter to check the water level.I would recommend purchasing this meter.", "This thing was great for the money. I use this all the time to water the plants. It\u2019s easy to read. I just follow the guide on the back of the box for each plant to water. I have a rattlesnake plant (calethea), snake plant, aloe, Norfolk pine, philodendron, pothos, zz plant, indoor fuschia, orchid, and indoor herbs. This is moisture meter makes it easy and no guessing. Everything is growing like crazy and looks great. I was not good with plants at all before I had this meter. Believe that if I can make house plant care with this thing, anyone can. I don\u2019t give too many outstanding reviews for things.", "I am someone who doesn't have a green thumb to say the least..maybe a necrotic thumb? I have killed cacti, air plants, ferns, you name it. About the only thing I can't seem to unintentionally kill is moss rose. This spring I got a great idea to completely clean up our balcony and outfit it with beautiful new plants-- ferns, hostas, purslanes, and a bunch of other things. Threw down a lot of money and within a few days my Rose of Sharon (an allegedly \"extremely easy to care for\" plant) was wilting. I decided it was time to order one of these meters and it's been so helpful in helping me not over or under water my new plants. My Rose of Sharon is perking up and my other plants are thriving. Totally worth the little bit of money spent!", "This meter works, but I think it is best for large planters and plants that don't need precise reading. The probe, while long, is THICK. If you have a small pot (say and tiny succulent in a seed-starting pot), this thing could serious hurt the roots of the plant, because it is so big. It is also not very detailed. I am reluctant to call it \"inaccurate\" because accuracy depends on what one needs. I tested a small succulent. The soil that came up with the probe felt moist between my fingers, yet the reading puts it at #2, labeled \"Dry\". So if I were to use this to decide whether or not to water the plant, I'd be making a big mistake. (FYI: There are 10 levels: 1, 2, 3: Dry; 4-7: Moist; 8-10: Wet).", "In addition to this meter, I have an identical-looking one that also measures pH and light, as well as moisture.  They never have the same reading even when inserted into the same spot in the soil.  I have quite a large collection of succulents and need to be able to measure moisture.  The succulent planting medium I use has no actual soil in it, so once the plant has been watered and the water runs out the drainage holes, there is no peat-y dirt to hold the water.  But if I water them again too soon, the roots will rot and it they will die.  I really need a good accurate meter!", "People think I have a green thumb when in reality this is my secret weapon. It\u2019s pretty easy to tell when an outdoor plant needs to be watered because if the weather has been hot, it\u2019s a given. But indoor plants are a little tricky. They don\u2019t dry out as quickly and the soil can feel wet when it\u2019s actually just cold. I bought this tool and I feel much more confident when I water my plants. There is also a guide on the back of the box that tells you when to water each type of plant. But the most part I wait until my plants read close to or at \u201cdry\u201d to avoid root rot. I was able to get my fiddle leaf fig to grow a new set of leaves thanks to this guy. And the fact that it doesn\u2019t need batteries was a nice surprise. Highly recommend if you\u2019re a new plant parent.", "This meter worked well for about a month and then no longer was acutely reading moisture. I cleaned the tip but no change. I sanded the tip down a bit to clean the surface and it again was able to read moisture levels. Sadly that only lasted for a few more readings and then again was useless. Will not buy again and would not recommend this particular product.", "I am a  plant killer!  Every spring - I buy tons of hanging baskets and plants and they are dead  by  June.  So  I started thinking - maybe I'm drowning them.  YES I WAS!  Ordered this  meter - and  I was SHOCKED at how my plants didn't need watering  every other day  like I thought -  heck many are going over a week before the meter tells me they are dry!  SO that confirmed all these years  me thinking because it is in the  90's and hot as fire outside -  the plants can hold their own for along time.  My plants are really amazing  this summer.  I HIGHLY recommend this - because I thought sticking my finger in the hanging baskets and they felt dry - needed water.  NOPE!  They are still very moist down low - where it counts.  Even for my garden -  looks amazing this year!  I'm not over watering anymore.", "I\u2019m very pleased with this moisture meter. This time of year (January), it\u2019s hard to find items like this locally - thank goodness for Amazon Prime.The first thing that impressed me with this meter was that it had explicit instructions for use. In reviews of various meters, buyers had commented they had tested a meter by sticking it into a cup of water and it still read DRY. The XLUX T10 instructions specifically advise against doing this - it can ruin your meter. Makes good sense!  They also anticipated other things one might complain about and addressed those as well.The meter itself works exactly as it should if one follows the instructions. The only purpose it didn\u2019t serve is checking the moisture in tiny little succulent pots. And, honestly, I really don\u2019t need it for that.I definitely recommend this product.", "Don't put it in water. That's not how this thing works - it says on the directions.It has worked great for me, like training wheels for houseplants. Using this has shown me the difference between wet and moist, that I'm not watering the soil evenly, and assuring me if the root-level is dry as the top. These are good things to know to start understanding each plant's nature. For example, some houseplants should be watered as soon as the first couple inches of the soil are dry. That means the lower soil might be moist. You could be making the plant suffer if you go too long between watering then. It's such an easy and cheap tool, totally worth it.", "Was a little bummed when I realized that it stopped working after 3 months. I noticed that my plants that I had just watered were reading as dry. So I gave them more water. About a week later, I noticed yellowing leaves and realized that they were over watered. I tested the meter on multiple plants. And while some read Wet, most read Dry. I decided to put the meter in some water, and the meter still read dry.However, while it was working, the meter was amazing! Super easy to use, read, and clean. Would buy again, but now I\u2019m hesitant. Not sure if it was a defect, or if they have a small life time. Giving it 2 stars because it stopped working so quickly. Otherwise it would have be 5/5 because I liked it so much.", "I love this moisture meter.  It's easy and does just one thing:  measures water accurately.  I lost many plants because the last meter read ph and light.  I didn't notice it broke and was stuck on the sun reading.Also - this product comes with an incredible warranty:  18 MONTHS!Price is well worth it.  My plants feel safe again.", "Trying to keep all my plants alive and they all have different needs and different posting soil.  I don't know how I survived without this.  You just stick it in your plant and it immediately tells you  the moisture level of the soil in simple easy to understand terms.  Great for hanging plants or ones on the top shelf that might dry out faster and be harder to check the soil to see if the plant needs watering.", "I can use my finger to test if the soil is truly dry or has some moisture in it pretty easily up to 2\" down or so better than this device - the soil will feel cold-ish and not at all \"dusty\", but this meter will report the same soil as \"dry\". In my experience, overwatering can kill your houseplants, so if your finger detects \"wet\" then definitely wait to water your plant.However, my finger can't reach down to the depth of the rod, and it is useful in that regard as I've been unsure as to whether to water a picky plant that prefers fully dry vs partially drained soil deeper down.", "I love my house plants but I don\u2019t exactly have a green thumb. I know the number one way you kill plants is by overwatering so I finally decided to get this. I should\u2019ve done it a lot sooner. All of my plants are so much more healthy. Some that I thought were in need of watering the meter would say were actually still pretty wet. Or ones that I would\u2019ve waited on we\u2019re actually too dry. I have so much more growth and just healthy looking plants after using this for a few months. Definitely worth the little bit of money I spent on it", "I love this little gizmo.  I have finally been able to stop over and under watering my plants!  This meter measures the ground moisture accurately and lets me know exactly how much water to add for each plant, herb and flower. There is a chart on the back of the box that tells you what each type of plant requires.  This has been a Godsend to a newbie gardener such as myself and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great for seasoned gardeners as well.  My plants are sure happier and healthier since I started using this.  I highly recommend it!", "I\u2019d been killing my houseplants and mostly guessing about soil wetness and dryness. Despite looking up how to take care of my various plants, and watering them the recommended amount, I either killed or seriously harmed my plants (my mother helped revive the ones that would be able to make it). This has been such a help - even though I\u2019ve only been using it for a couple weeks, I can tell it\u2019s something that I needed. Despite the first couple centimeters of the soil bring moist, deeper down, the soil would be dry and I\u2019ve learned a better watering schedule. Lastly, this product is VERY easy to use; just stick it in your pot and it\u2019ll tell you how dry or wet the soil is!", "Love this! My plants are thriving so much better since I started using this gauge. During lockdown, I decided to get into some indoor gardening. Knowing nothing about plants, their care was very trial and error for me, esp when it came to watering. Thanks to this meter, I\u2019ve noticed my plants getting stronger over time, because they\u2019re no longer over nor under watered. Be sure to wipe the tip of the meter with something rough each time before use. Oh, and keep the box! It lists the level for any type of plant you have.", "I\u2019ve tried using moisture meters in the past with so-so results. After my initial use, this unit is fantastic. I maintain a house full of plants (over 125), the majority in eclectic planters with no drainage (only horticultural charcoal in the bottom for drainage), so I have difficulty in determining water needs with an inserted finger test in the soil. I don\u2019t know how I lived without this meter for years \u2013 shows degree of moisture at different depths, plus it\u2019s great for finding dry spots in the root area (water just doesn\u2019t flow \u201cnicely\u201d to evenly moisten all the soil). The metal sensing stem of this unit must also be good for aerating the hardened soil. Also the stem does not have to be cleaned for each soil insertion.", "Yeah... the product is definitely not well-calibrated. I stuck it into an array of pots ranging from way-dry to recently, heavily watered, but it pretty rigidly designated each as being in the dry spectrum. After like 8 pots I was pretty curious and decided to put it into the waterbottle I was carrying to water my balcony plants with and it finally moved up from \"dry\" and into \"moist\" but not up to \"wet,\" the highest category along the scale.I feel like the inability to acknowledge pure water as the highest point on the scale makes it relatively obvious the product quality is impractically poor; how can one trust a hydrometer that doesn't even fully recognize water as wet?", "I have tons of houseplants, and always get compliments on them.But water schedules are impossible because they all have their moods, and sticking my finger in the dirt got old.Bought this thing, and now all of them are thriving even better than before.It makes watering an exact science, and all of them are loving it.Check them all daily, water those who need it, and all the stress of trying to make 'schedules that will work' has gone out the window - for the better. No thinking need be wasted.", "I just got this today and tried it out in several plants with different soil conditions and it read accurately when it went from one plant that was moist (just watered it) and then right to one that was noticeably dry.  No batteries needed with is a plus and not expensive either.  I just wanted something that would be more accurate in deciding when to water. I tend to either water to often or not often enough so I just need to make it a routine every couple of days to stick this in the soil which registers right away. You should read the instructions as it says do not stick it directly into water and wipe it clean each time to get a correct reading.  It does come with a year warrantee too so you can't go wrong on the investment.", "We, like so many others, planted our first garden this year. Due to a limited area of sun we used raised planters on legs. What we needed help with was how often to water and how much. We bought the Soil Moisture Sensor Meter and have not had to worry about keeping the tomato plants consistently moist. It works as intended and has made our job much easier. We joked that we\u2019d probably end up with a couple of $300 tomatoes but our harvest has actually been quite good.", "I was careful to follow the instructions plus of other reviewers.  I gently inserted the needle into the soil that were watered the night before and it read dry.  Fine, maybe it is dry.  I tried it again on a few spots in the pot, but still read dry.  I understand it shouldn't be used directly in water so i watered the soil, waited a few minutes, inserted the meter and it still ready dry?  It did move a hair but seriously?  I would say it should be at least 'moist'.  Tried it one more time and it was a very humid day indoors, it still ready dry.  Finally gave up and am returning it.  Sadly I will continue to stick my finger in the soil and guess if my plants need watering until I find something that works.", "I use moisture meters regularly for my houseplants. I constantly misplace them so I wanted to get a couple back ups. I tested both out and put them in very moist. They read only slightly moist. While my older one that I use all the time read \u201cvery moist\u201d almost \u201cwet\u201d.I am returning these. They would lead a lot of people to completely over water their plants and kill them.I realize moisture meters are just a gauge and not 100% accurate. These however are 100% inaccurate and if you relied on these you would be in trouble.", "I ordered two or these moisture readers, one for me and one for my daughter. Mine works fine, hers doesn\u2019t work at all. She used before and it right after she watered her plants and it read dry both time with all her plants. You\u2019re taking a chance of getting one that works if you order this product.", "I try to kill them.  Not intentionally of course.  But I overwater, underwater, can't keep track of which needs watering when.Now, I pick a time, once a week, when I go around and measure.  They get a lot of water or a little or none at all depending on the reading and they're thriving.Try to avoid getting too close to the plant and punching the roots.I can't truly comment on accuracy, as it specifically says not to stick it into just water, but it seems to be working.  Great value.", "It was always hot and miss, not knowing how much water each area of my vegetable garden needed. I\u2019d wind up with yellowing plants and didn\u2019t know if it was because they needed water or if I overwatered them. Now with this meter, I measure the water levels around the garden each morning, to see what my plants need. The meter acts as a teaching guide. I\u2019m in the process of figuring out how to adjust my water timers to irrigate for the right amount of time and at the right intervals. The irrigation timers are still not perfect but getting closer to the mark thanks to having this objective water measure. It\u2019s awesome!!", "So this device is very easy to use, and for the money I don\u2019t think you can beat it. I have over 200 house plants and it is helping me with my more delicate plants. My note of caution would be to test various soil moisture levels so you can get an accurate idea of what the reading correlates to. Personally I believe that it underestimates a little, so it\u2019s reading moist when my finger tells me it\u2019s pretty wet. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Now that have a have an accurate scale for what each level means this has become a useful tool.", "I got one out of curiosity because so many people swear by moisture meters\u2014 yeah, this one doesn\u2019t work. I tried a million things to get it to read. Stuck it in the soil of a sopping-wet boston fern and a bone-dry snake plant. Left it there for ten minutes, thirty, an hour. Wiggled it forward, backwards, left, right\u2014 just to try and get the meter to read. It stayed under a \u201c4\u201d for everything. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it out to return it in time thanks to the \u2018Rona, so it\u2019s sitting in the trash at my curb where it belongs.", "At first I thought this product was wonderful, it was easy to use and definitely easy to read. Thought it'd be the perfect thing for my variety of potted plants. Had a blast the first day as soon as I got it reading the moisture levels of my soils. The next day rolls around and I was curious how much the moisture contents of the plants changed over a 24 hour period only to find that the meter stopped working. Gave it a few more days and watered my plants waited a few hours to test the moisture content only to find that it says the soil was Dry. Completely Dry, except that the soil definitely wasn't. Please note, I read the directions before using this product and you ARE NOT supposed to put the sensor directly in water. I made sure that the sensor never directly contacted water by waiting quite some time before measuring moisture after watering my plants. Regardless, after that first day the meter still hasn't worked.", "I liked the fact that it was long and easy to read. I did not like the fact that after a few uses the tip came off.  They are very specific that it must be wiped with a roughish cloth ( I used paper towels) and I didn't use any force. For a while it worked then the meter readings were all over the place until finally it just stopped doing its thing! Even after watering my plants the meter read dry. This has great reviews which is why I bought it but I found it cheaply made and now I have to buy another one. SO, as far as the price being \"right\", You get what you pay for and now I will be paying more..LOL", "I bought this because I invested in planting two trees and  bush and several flowers and plants and tomatoes this year and I didn't want to kill any of them by over or under watering them. As I have done in the past with houseplants. It was inexpensive and doesn't require batteries.I love this device! It's extremely simple to use. You just put it in the dirt where your plant is and it gives an instant reading.It has already stopped me from overwatering. There have already been times that I thought something was dry and the meter told me it was moist enough.I use it every day before I start watering.", "I had a cheap moisture meter for decades that worked fine seems to be missing. So been trying to find one that is accurate or at least (really) lets you know if you need to water or not. I bought the fancey triple function double spike one thinking this is got to be the best. the PH part did nothing so sent it back. The replacement one the moisture part is not reliable it says it's wet and it's not been watered for days in AZ in the summer. So bought this Xlux brand with just single spike that does much less root damage each time it is inserted. This one showed me just what I expected these plants were near bone dry. I am going to buy another one right away as a backup. Simple meter, looks great, easy to read, it works fabulous.", "This items grossly undermeasures moisture in the soil.  Plants that I know are damp (because I stick my finger in the soil) are reading as dry.  Plants that I just watered and I know are very wet are coming as up a level 4 or 5 moist.  It's very inaccurate. I have another, 2 pronged meter for my outdoor plants that I also used for comparison. And yes, I wiped it clean before using and between each poke.  If I relied on this my alocasias would die from overwatering.", "I used the meter as instructed, wiping the shaft with \"rough paper\" before using it. It said all of my plants I watered an hour prior (I gave the soil time to absorb the water) and it still said dry. As an experiment, I watered a pot of soil with no plants just to see how \"moist\" the meter thinks the soil should be. Soaking wet is the answer! If I watered my plants with that much water, they would drown! I was trying to correct my over watering issue, not make it worse!", "Many of us in soCAL have at least a small yard that is drip irrigated, but you never know when or where the irrigation fails. If you suspect that a plant isn't getting enough water or you don't know when to turn down your system in the season when your yard is getting too much water, this simple device will tell you. When you don't have enough water in spots, you can add water so that a plant doesn't dry out, and when you have too much water in spots, you can cut back watering so that you don't kill the plant, a major cause of plants dying, especially indoor plants.", "I am an avid gardener and grow seedlings and starts indoors in pots 2-6 inches in diameter before setting them outdoors. Will admit I was skeptical the product could perform under these limited micro uses- but first time use on established starts showed watering needs at the individual plant level. Prior to use of the meter, I was watering on a tray basis- what a difference this tool made in regards to my assumptions. I only grow small quantities indoors which makes attending to individual starts a reality.  Hands down a good purchase for me.", "I just added a bunch of mixed drought resistant plants to my landscaping (cacti, succulents, shrubs, trees) all of which are on drip irrigation.  Since the programming and drip rates are different, I needed to independently check that all of the plants were getting the right amount of water.  This measuring device worked well for that job and it was easy to use; simply wipe the dirt off of the probe after each measurement and stick into the ground at different distances from the plant root ball and check the reading.  If in the blue range, plenty of moisture in the soil.", "This is an ok soil moister reader. When I first put it in and leave it there for about an hour or so to get it to set before adding water to the pot. After i watered it for about 5-10 minutes it still was reading dry and even after about half an hour after watering it the needle was in the middle not on the green side reading moist. So I don't know if this is a great way to read if your soil has a lot of moisture or not but i probably wouldn\u2019t get this again.", "I spent hundreds of dollars on plants and dozens of hours putting gardens in around my house this year. Within weeks everything was struggling. I had been watering daily as all my plants sat in summer heat all day but I couldn't figure out why nothing was thriving. Tried this out and turns out I was waaaay over watering. I started using this to track which plants actually needed water and I noticed an improvement within days. Within in week everything had greened up and was growing again. At the price point what have you got to lose? Highly recommend, no exaggeration my gardening 'career' was almost over before it started and this saved it! Directions on the box are straightforward and clear, easy to use.", "When I initially received it I was rather excited about the ability to measure my house plants moisture level. From the very beginning I felt that it seemed to read the soil as drier than I thought it was- but, I guess who doubts science or the machines. Well, after just 3-mnths it just stopped working. Just died. I don't know how. I never dropped. I always cleaned after each use. It just stopped working. Please, don't waste your money on this.", "The original moisture meter was defective, but the replacement seems to be reading the soil properly. Looking through the reviews on how well the moisture reader performs, the item either works well or not at all. Since I did have to return the original item due to it not working, I deducted a star. However, the seller sent a replacement immediately after I notified them of the defective item and the new moisture reader seems to be working fine.", "Sadly, I am not sure about this moisture meter.. in a sink full of water it's reading between dry and moist.I just watered my plants yesterday, so I wanted to check with this.. it read dry... so I went hmm.. I checked a 6 inch pot in 5 different locations and depth, same dry reading.. so I put some water in my sink and checked it. My sink is between dry and moist.... not correct at all.", "Great that you don't need to worry about batteries with this tool.Some plants suffer greatly if they are over watered, being able to stick a probe in the soil and instantly know if it's moist or not is super handy. Especially in large pots it can be impossible to tell whether 3 inches down the soil is still moist or not. Of course some plants don't do well with too little water, but you don't really need a device to tell you that the soil is nicely moist.", "I used this thing for 6 months starting last September and it died this past week (March). Odd since I didn't use it at all in December-February and was always careful to wipe the tip after each use. I had the kind with a square green top/dial for years, maybe 8 (I wasn't counting) before it died and assumed both kinds (square & rounded) probably had the same electronics inside, but now don't think so. Just ordered the square one again and hopefully it will last for years.", "This old school moisture meter is hands down the best thing I\u2019ve purchased for my plants. I always want to overwater, and trying to avoid that makes me underwater. This simple to use meter is exactly what I needed. You just stick it in your plant, and the needle moves accordingly. One of the reasons I bought this one is because it\u2019s long enough for my largest pots. I can check all the soil including the very bottom. An added benefit is that it helps aerate the soil if you\u2019re checking multiple areas of each pot. I love this thing and I want to buy one for each room I keep plants in. 5 stars.", "Very pleased so far. I am using for both indoor house plants as well as outside potted plants and raised garden beds. I have always had an in ground garden so when I started my raised beds, I wanted to be sure the roots would grow down to seek out the moisture. I use soaker hoses in the beds and test after watering to make sure I\u2019ve watered throughly, then I water again when the meter is in mid dry zone. So far my beds are doing great.", "Zero stars. Didn\u2019t work fresh out of the box. Tried it per the directions waiting about 10 minutes after inserting in my plants soil but all said the same which isn\u2019t possible as some had been watered the day before or earlier that day. Horrible and shouldn\u2019t even be on Amazon.", "This has changed everything about how I take care of my plants (and help them live much more successfully). I was definitely the reason why my fiddle fig and zizi plants were looking lack luster...two plants that are supposed to be wonderfully durable! I was OVER watering by a lot. Likewise, other plants were too dry. Seriously, if you need help knowing when to water (who doesn't?), this gadget is ingenious. Love that the box also has dozens of plant names with watering suggestions.", "I have a lot of indoor plants and most need different environments... sun, moisture, temp etc. This was so easy to use to help manage how much i water my plants. The most helpful part was that the back of the box it has a listing of common house plants and what range they should be in. Its helped me identify that some of my plants were doing poorly because they were too wet. Its such a simple fix. it was a good price for a good quality product that gets the job done. I'm able to quickly check my plants every morning before work. PERFECT.", "I made this purchase for outdoor landscape plants.  The padded envelope had been cut open with scissors or a knife and the box inside was opened as well.  There were no instructions or purchase order inside and the only instructions were on the outside of the box and difficult to read.  The probe was bowed but I didn't think that should be a big problem so tried it in the garden anyway.  I am a serious gardener and had watered everything earlier in the day.  Some of the same plants registered dry and some very wet.  I re-read some of the comments which caused me to wonder if this particular tester might be better suited for indoor potted plants?  I had to give only 2 stars for ease of use and reading because when using in the garden,  one must kneel on the ground for each plant and lie your head close to see the reading.  I chose this particular Tester because of the positive comments and ease of use.  I honestly don't think the bowed probe could have made such a dramatic difference In reading and wonder if anyone might suggest another model that would be more appropriate for landscape plants?  I don't need one that gives the P H for soil because I have mulch brought in every 1-2 yrs. to ensure the best possible soil for my plants.  Simple - accurate - and easy to read would be wonderful.  Thank you.", "I bought this to make sure I was able to keep track of how moist/wet the soil was for my plants that don't like much water. It seemed fine at first but then stopped working after the 3rd time I used it. It says my plant's soil is at 1-2, which is dry, so I gave it a quarter cup of water, only to see the pot overflow and spill everywhere. I don't often water this plant since it's in the bonsai family and doesn't like much water. It's hard to tell how much is water is in this pot, as I bought the plant from a lowes store that had it preplanted in a decorative pot that had only holes halfway up the side of the pot. After overflowing, it still says 1-2. It clearly is completely soaked and leaving the meter there for a about 20 minites showed the same results...", "This gage is amazing simple and accurate to measure moisture in soil. ( no batteries needed) I carefully put the prong of hydrometer in about 2-3\" deep check several different lawn locations and outside plants for moisture to see if I need to to turn on my sprinkler system. Works great no longer overwatering or underwatering lawn. My lawn looks great now, even during the hot summer months, and saving a bundle of $$$ on water bill.", "Saw this on a gardener's Instagram stories. Never heard of a water monitor, but this thing works! Pull it straight out of the box and begin using. Could not recommend more for those of you, like me, who love plans but are still learning how to properly care for them. Several of my plants looked so dry, but when I actually stuck this in the dirt they read as 'moist' and didn't actually need any water. Others, as suspected, were dry as a bone and did need some water. Great for plants that don't \"tell\" you they're in need of water by drooping.", "I love this I tend to overwater my plants. Now I don\u2019t have to. I suggest putting it in a couple of different spots in the dirt. Remember not to hurt your plants roots.Update: this particular one seems to have stopped working unfortunately I really liked it to, bummer!I stuck it in completely dry dirt , it read. MOIST disappointing.", "Doesn\u2019t work at all. I tried to use it for my indoor plants. I have fiddle leaf figs, Calatheas , alocasia and they are all particular with water. It reads my moist compact alocasia as dry and my calathea in a self watering planter as wet when the bottom is moist and the top soil is absolutely dry.  It has really inaccrurate readings. It worked the first couple of times - maybe. Then it\u2019s just been all over the place I definitely can\u2019t trust it.", "I bought this to check the soil around a new Cereus cactus I planted in Arizona. I had freshly watered it and the gauge didn't move. Then I watered my Desert Williow treets and put the gauge into the ground -- no measurement at all. Do not order this thing.", "I think I have a brown thumb! So, this unit has aided me in determining if my new potted plants require water or if that have retained enough water down at the root level to skip a watering instead of just guessing and potentially drowning the poor plants.I can't speak about long-term performance but so far, this unit has been great. Just remember to wipe the probe after each individual use so that readings are accurate and the probe remains dry and clean for the next use.", "You have to stick the prob an inch or two into the soil and then twist and wiggle the prob around to get a reading. If you just insert the prob it will still say dry. Even after I throughly drenched my potted plants, the gauge barely moved from dry to moist (after a great deal of turning and wiggling). The gauge does note really move enough to discern whether the soil is wet or dry. So far, the wettest soil barely read as moist. Not sure this is better than sticking my finger in the pot.", "UPDATE 6/21: Its in the trash can. After a few months it no longer works. It is not accurate at all. I have decided that the old fashion finger is the best option for gauging moister of the soil. Waste of money in my opinion and will not last long.I\u2019ve been using this tool for a few months and honestly I\u2019ll probably by another kind soon. It\u2019s easy to use but not the most accurate. Mine constantly reads as \u201cdry\u201d even if the plant has just been watered. I have found tho that if you leave it in the soil or 5 minutes you\u2019ll get a more accurate reading, but that takes too much time when you have 10 plants to check.", "I tested this a bit on plants that I knew were dry or more wet and the readings were accurate. I had this one palm I got from the store that hasn\u2019t been doing well (I\u2019ve moved it to different lightings and experimented with water + humidity) and I gave it a try and to my shock the soil was completely wet despite looking dry. Sure enough, I looked and my plant had root rot and a lake at the bottom because my drainage holes were not working! I repotted so everything is good now but I have since recommended to all my plant loving friends!", "I bought the unit (lower left center of photo) to assure moisture on newly planted row junipers.  Although I have soaker hose supplying water, I did not know if the soil near the roots of the plants was moist enough.  I have an investment of $6,000.00+ in these plants.  because of the mulch surrounding them, I could not be sure that they were properly watered.  The hydrometer works perfectly and quickly, assuring me that the whole row of the plantings are safely  watered.  So, I am protecting my new hedge for a bit more than $10 bucks!  A bargain!", "I\u2019m sure it works fine for potted plants but I purchased it for my turf.  This purchase was the second since January this year.  The first one lasted almost six months with occasional use only about twice a month because of the extremely wet weather this Spring.It failed due to the tip coming out in the ground.  Probably my fault since I was placing around six inches into soft soil.  Maybe I took from the ground too fast and the soil sucked out the tip.  Then while reading reviews, I read that I should only insert it four inches.  Okay, I accepted the blame as user error and purchased another.  Cautiously sinking it into the ground only 4\u201d maximum and removing gently from soft wet soil according to the tester, again the tip failed on the third attempt.  Guess it\u2019s time to up my purchase price for a more durable tester as I do not accept this failure as user error.", "I bought this moisture meter in April. I have used it exactly 4 times. I watered a plant and put the meter in and it came up dry, so I tried some other freshly watered plants and it still said dry\u2026 I then sat the meter in water and it went up to mid moist\u2026 if it is sitting IN WATER it should say WET\u2026 Buy another meter, mine was in it\u2019s original box in the plastic bag it came in\u2026 WASTE OF MONEY GET ANOTHER BRAND!", "I\u2019ve had this a total of 5 minutes and I\u2019ve already gone around to my 40+ plants and tested the soil. 10/10 would recommend.  I had no idea I could be so excited about possibly not killing my plants.  This is so easy to use. Just stick it in and it tells you if your soil is dry/ wet or moist . I check a couple soots to make sure and if it\u2019s in the dry I feed my babies some water.  I am so excited that I have this!", "Very easy to use product. A tip to be extra certain of the accuracy of the reading would be to look at the tip of the moisture meter after taking it out of the soil \u2014 if there\u2019s soil stuck to it and it feels moist, then you\u2019ll know that the soil is not completely dry.", "I'm pretty sure this was defective out of the box. I was hoping to use it to test the moisture level of the gritty soil mix my succulents are in. So first I tested it in all my succulents. Meter read 1 (completely dry). So I watered one that I knew was needing a good soaking and tested again, still reading 1. I thought maybe it was because the soil was too gritty so I tried it in regular soil. Meter read 1 both dry and right after watering.", "I don't know if I received a defective product but this item does not work _at all_. I tried it in bone dry potted plants and ones I had just thoroughly watered. The meter only ever reads, \"dry\". Returning it.", "Absolutely love this meter.  It is simple, straightforward and easy to use/read.  I discovered that I had been overwatering my basil while underwatering many others.  Now everything gets exactly what they need.  I am a container gardener.  When I started my garden I had two dogs and a very small garden.  To keep the dogs from wandering through my tomatoes and peppers I put everything into pots and should have had the presence of mind to buy a moisture meter then - but I didn't.  Now I know the value of having a moisture meter and this one is great!", "I had to buy another one because the previous one I damaged by leaving it in a plant for days before I realized it was in the plant. However, future iterations of this product and similar ones should improve on the size of the information you are trying to measure. Also, is there any way to \"light\" up the display once the dial registers the water moisture of the plant. It would be so much easier than shining a flashlight or using your IPhone light to be able to see what is being measured. Thanks", "This thing is perfect. I had a triple use one, where it would measure lighting and PH as well as moisture but it went bad within a year. The moisture reading would read the same on every plant, even ones that I knew were super dry, or super wet. This one gives me a very accurate reading every time. I also love that there\u2019s only one prong, it slides in easier and I feel like it\u2019s not crushing up my roots. I love it!", "When you are in its dry \"red zone\" there actually is some moisture In your plants. Doesn't make a whole lot of difference with most plants, but if you have succulents you better be careful NOT to over-water them when this meter is saying they are \"dry\" - because they aren't. Also, be sure to wipe the tip regularly - I use some very fine steel wool - that helps to get a better reading.", "This plant meter is amazing. It\u2019s so easy to use and easy to read.  Famous with my family for overwatering and killing my plants, I saw this product and decided to try it out. This helped save my plants, especially a big palm I bought. When I started to use the meter, I stopped watering the plant because I could see from the meter that the plant was still wet and weeks after the bottom of the pot is still wet and saturated with water. Pulling out the meter I could feel it wet so I know I wasn\u2019t imagining things. If I hadn\u2019t had the meter I would have still been watering the plant every single week and that would have been disastrous. Thanks a whole lot for this product. It\u2019s truly wonderful.", "It took me a little time to figure out how best to use it and I find it serves as a guide. I appreciate that. Anything that helps. My judgment and feelings always best and this does help. I do wish there was a Zero on the Guage so as to better understand the back listing guide on the back. The company/seller never got back to me on that. But like I said you can get to understand it as a guide.", "Ordered and received the XLUX T10 Soil Moisture Sensor. When I pushed the tip into the soil, per instructions, the meter finger didn't move. I tried the sensor in a variety of wet and dry soils. On tilting the sensor, I found that the meter finger flopped from side to side. I replaced it through Amazon.The second arrived and I tested it in damp soil. The meter finger jumped to the green soil-is-moist range!Unfortunately, after placing it in super-saturated soil, I found that the meter finger never gave a reading higher than halfway.I don't plan to but this brand again.", "I bought this meter mid July and have been happy with it until this week. This week all my plants are driest of dry according to the meter. Spoiler - they\u2019re actually not dry at all.I followed all directions and kept the meter in a safe place - not dropped or exposed to any elements and sadly, even with the utmost care, it no longer works. Which means I\u2019m off to find a more reliable less persnickety moisture meter for my plants.", "My daughter bought me a beautiful little plant and I thought for sure it probably wouldn't survive if I didn't have some kind of a moisture to help me know when to water it.  The soil seemed to be a little damp but a couple of leaves had developed dry spots.  So I presumed I wasn't giving it enough water.  After using the moisture meter I watered it more and the little plant perked right up and looks great.  I don't have a green thumb so I know this will help all of my little house plants stay alive and look just beautiful.", "Nice inexpensive instrument. It\u2019s hard to speak of its accuracy, but it measures a 9 right after watering and  then you can track the dryness after that point. I water my plants when it gets to about a 2. It\u2019s an instant read device, stick it in the soil and you get results. Don\u2019t leave it in the soil as it may corrode, take 3-4 readings in multiple locations of your pot and then clean it off. It\u2019s very handy and stops over & under watering.", "We have long dealt with the problem of over-watering our plants.  That has all now changed significantly by purchasing this soil moisture sensor meter.  It works as great for outside plants as it does for those inside.  So, no more leggy plants now that we only water them when the meter shows it is time.  How great it is to finally have plants that look healthy.  There is nothing complicated about this meter.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who lacks the inherant knack of knowing just how often and how much to water their plants.", "I used it pretty frequently to help take care of my plants. Never seemed to work 100% - for example I had this plant that I would water, then stick the probe in and it would still read dry - I eventually reported thinking maybe the water wasn\u2019t getting through to the soil but still same issue was happening with the probe and then started to happen with other plants. Stopped using it for a bit and relied on my finger. thought I\u2019d give it another shot but now it always reads dry even for plants that I know are not dry. I guess for $10 I got what I paid for? Not sure how to reach out to seller for warranty.", "Don't waste your money on this product or any similar ones! Horrible quality, you can definitely tell it is a cheaply made product. Works the first couple of times, and then for some reason it won't read anything other than \"DRY\", even when I put it in soil that is completely saturated! Better off just doing a finger test and digging around in the soil on your own than be misled by this faulty meter.", "I definitely do not have a green thumb. I recently inherited various house plants from my daughter who was moving and did not have room for them. Since I have no clue when or how often to water them, I decided to get this meter. It works very well. It lets me know when the soil is dry, moist, or wet, so I know when I need to water. I recommend this product. It has worked well so far.", "I don't hate it but don't love it. Not sure if it works? I wish it came with some direction or what to expect. Probably will keep it...but ao far not that impressive. The box it came in was totally demolished but the item itself wasn't broken.", "This nifty moisture meter does one thing and does it well! Doesn't use or require batteries. Quick and easy to check soil in your potted plants so you don't over water, which is a leading cause of plant demise. I've never used it outdoors but mfr says it's good for that, too. Best gardening tool I've bought in years. Going to order another so I have one for upstairs and downstairs.", "This thing single-handedly saved my plants! Like so many people, I was a habitual over-waterer and the only thing I\u2019d been able to keep alive was an aloe vera, which seems to thrive on neglect. I take two readings on each plant in different areas of the pot, and they are almost always the same, so I\u2019d say the accuracy is pretty spot on. I have sand covering a lot of my plants to help deter flies, so it can be hard to tell if the soil is dry or not. Now I know about how often to check each plant, and if it\u2019s in the red, I give it a drink. A+ from me and I have already recommended it to a few friends!", "I\u2019m new to the plant life and wanted to get this reader to help me gauge water level on my plants . I received the reader and it\u2019s pretty straightforward to use but I don\u2019t believe it gives an accurate read. For example, I just got a snake plant that was freshly watered a few days prior to me using the reader and it noted the plant was very dry. Snake plants don\u2019t require frequent watering so I don\u2019t believe this was accurate.Not sure if I\u2019m using it incorrectly but wanted to share", "The meter seems to accurate and is helpful, when it works. I\u2019ve had one for almost two months and it recently stopped working. When you try to find warranty info here on Amazon you get the \u201ccheck with manufacturer\u201d response, which is becoming more and more common here. Also more common is the inability fo find any contact info on manufacturers in search engines. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s no accident.", "I don\u2019t know what voodoo magic it uses, but this little thing is pretty cool. I had just been watering everything every week or two, mostly my plants were ok but I always lost a few while others are obviously failing to thrive. A few weeks of using this and I can clearly see where I was going wrong with some plants, even have one reviving g itself nicely now. Quite the bargain that pays for itself easily.", "I purchased two brands, this single probe and a dual probe.  They both read the same (good) the probe is strong enough to push through grass sod.  I did use in a flower pot, and didn't get any reading, but determined the soil/drain rock used didn't allow enough contact on the probe.  Pushed into normal dirt, works fine.  just FYI, if you don't get a reading, it may be your soil.", "Love this! I was always trying to figure out how to water my plants. Somehow always overwatering. No more guessing. Just quick check of my plants each day and then I know if they are thirsty. So surprising that there is no pattern to watering them, even with my indoor plants. I just water when meter reads on the low side of moist. No more guessing!", "Had another version of this product 20+ year ago - had a sunflower design head. Worked every time, then it must have went off to Salvo in a sorting frenzy.  This product worked fine and was necessary for my deeper pots.  Understand the concept- different metals create small current using moisture. Never forced into hard soil and always removed debris after use.  After about 6 weeks, it quit showing any reading even for plants watered earlier in the day. A slight tap on the product head showed that the pointer was moving freely.  Discovered that if I put a small amount of sideways pressure on the meter head, it would show a reading which did change depending upon the moisture of the soil.  So the probe was creating current, and there must be a loose / weak connection in the wiring going to the meter.

HAPPY WATERING!!", "I was wondering about the accuracy of this meter and its construction.. I use it on my succelents..The meter is very accurate, easy to use easy to read... As the instructions state make sure there are no rocks in the way. Never put in a glass of water.. The price at $9.99 is a bargin..  The probe will get bent if you are not carefull.. I test the mosture by putting the meter at root depth..  I would reccomend this meter if you are a succelent fan...  I would buy again if need be.. Delivery was two days after ordering... 100% satisfied..", "I purchased this in February for my 4 year old's indoor planting projects this Spring.  She got started this week, and when we tested the soil in her pots her excitement turned to disappointment when the meter only read \"dry\", no matter how moist the soil was.  Highly reviewed, but does ours does not work, at all!  Company needs some sort of quality control at the end of their production line - this is a simple step that would help ensure satisfied customers.  As it stands now, it looks like I'm another unsatisfied customer who is unable to return a product that was defective out of the box.  BUYER BEWARE!", "I love this! I was surprised how easy it is to use. I pop it in my plants for 2 seconds and use the small watering can I'm carrying along if necessary. I thought I knew if some of my plants needed water. I guessed wrong about 30% of the time. I'm so excited about this that I immediately bought my mother in law one for mother's day and I plan on getting one for my mom too!", "I'm an avid succulent plant lady.  I propagate, grow and collect succulents.  I love plants and try to treat them right.  Not too much water and not too little water.  This meter is such a help with this step.  It takes all the guess work out of watering.  I've had plants in my care die from too little watering to too much watering.  Not anymore!  Love it and use it all the time!  If your a plant person like me I can recommend this nifty gadget to test the soil to know which ones need water and which can wait.", "This is a second review because I bought one meter for myself, then bought another as a gift.  I am sorry for the repetition, but do not like to just delete a request from Amazon.  I like the meter.  I think it should explain more about at what level you need to start watering again.  There is a list of plants on the box, but none of those are what I have in my house, so I just look at the meter and if it's on the low side, I water.  If it's on the upside, I don't.  But it does tell the difference between dry soil and damp or wet soil.", "It takes some fiddling around to get a proper reading. You definitely might need to turn it this way or that and put it in deeper for a better reading. If you follow the instructions you shouldn't have an issue.

I use it diligently everyday to check my vegetables that I planted in pots. It must be reading the moisture accurately because my vegetables have been growing beautifully since the meter shows its wet towards the roots and I don\u2019t have to water them often.It\u2019s a simple device and more than enough for what I need it to be.", "Update:  I contacted their customer service and they shipped me out a new one the next day!  Great customer service.The meter works great and hopefully now I will not kill anymore plants.It broke after one day.  I stuck it in the plant and the tip came off!  I\u2019m contacting the manufacturer.  We shall see how good their customer service is.", "I bought this for my FLF and it seems to do the trick. Yeah you can use your finger...I don't want to. So I purchased this little guy and its works well. As another review states, please know how to use it correctly. This same meter goes for quite a bit more $$$ at the nursery near me. I say its well worth it to purchase one to keep on hand if you're a plant parent.", "I water with love...I promise. But apparently that was giving to much love. This sensor measures deep into the soil to let me know when to water. My plants get pretty dry on top but the roots hold much more water. I\u2019m watering every month or so now vs. every two weeks which was a no no. Only thing I wish is that I could keep it inserted in the plant but apparently that\u2019s a no no too. Although slowly...I\u2019m learning.", "I purchased two of these moisture monitors to use with a 47 year old Christmas Cactus and 20 year old Jade. I know that i could use just one monitor but decided to get one for each plant. We just leave the monitors in the soil all the time..

It does not require batteries.", "This little gadget has already saved a number of plants for me. A friend gave me some beautiful plants. I hadn't taken care of plants too well in the past. With this gauge I was able to tell that the plants had plenty of water when I would have watered them way too much. This is a very handy little device. I have one in my home and one in my gallery!  : )", "I lost a moisture meter I had for 30 years.  I freaked out because I have never seen them in garden shops!  Amazon to the rescue.  they work well.  Just push it down into the pot and read it. As you pull it up, keep your eye on the guage.  Some plants are bone dry at the top, but soggy at the roots. There are also meters for PH and other soil conditions", "I only bought this because after 40 years of gardening, I have to grow in raised containers and since I am an eclectic collector of growing containers, each container has its own moisture personality. This instrument will help me know when to water. I would like it better if the face of the instrument was attached perpendicular to the rod that you insert into the soil.....would be easier to read. That's a feature I will look for next time.", "Super easy to use and read. I bought this meter because I was overwatering my house plants. I had a few people mention a water meter but was instantly intimidated by the sound of that. I finally decided to buy one myself and boy am I forever thankful I did. You just pop it in the soil, I recommend putting it in a couple different spots and it instantly tells you if the soil is wet,  moist or dry.  If you want to be a good plant patent I highly recommend this product.", "Great product. Arrived on time, safely packaged. I almost killed that poor plant. Sensor showed dry as a bone!  Did not realize how much water it needed. So I will continue to monitor the plant. I also checked all my other plants too. Now the sensor showed different moisture levels on each plant which makes me think the readings are accurate.I recommend this product and will buy again.", "I was using one that measured several things...while all I needed was the read on moisture.....this is a delight to use!I know that some have use for multi -uses...but I don't.....I'm in Arizona summertime....watering can easily be overdone or underdone, so this is a great help. In cooler parts of the year, it's obvious to me on how I have to water....but not in the heat of summer.", "Every single plant I put this in reads level 1 dry. The meter doesn\u2019t move or read any other numbers. Some of them have visibly moist soil. I do the finger test and the soil is moist yet the meter doesn\u2019t change, it has read all 25 of my plants as level 1 dry. I\u2019m super disappointed! It\u2019s easy to read and use but unfortunately is not accurate at all.", "The reason I rated this product so low is, until I received it and read the instructions, I didn\u2019t realize that I couldn\u2019t just leave it in the ground. According to the instructions, you\u2019re supposed to pull it out of the ground and clean off the probe after each reading. Not what I wanted, and this limitation wasn\u2019t obvious to me before I bought it.", "The last thing I want to do is stuff my finger into my potted plants in an effort to decide whether to give them water. This meter takes the guess work out of it, allowing quick checks shallow and deep, toward the window and in the back. Outside use is also valuable for plants like Hydrangeas, which don't like to be dried out or drowned. Very nice!", "I am new to being a plant parent. I need all the help I can get. This little tool works well  its easy to read and use  It does warn agaist leaving the probe in the soil for more that an hour.

I would recommend this to any new or master gardener.", "Put the probe in a glass of water after first opening the package and got no reading.  Then tested houseplants and several outdoor potted and landscaping plants and compared the readings to my other hydrometer. This new one reads as my old one does, and it's accurate enough at reading soil moisture to keep plants from drying out or drowning.", "I ordered the Xlux soil tester (two actually)  as it had one prong, instead of the three prongs I have on my current meter.  It would be easier for use with my larger, thickly leafed, more mature plants as I only needed a moisture meter, without a ph or fertility gauge feature.I wasn't getting a reading from the Xlux of what I should have had for my watering schedule. It showed my plants were at  a satisfactory moisture level, so I used my current Rapitest three prong meter just to compare to be safe, and it read a severe moisture deficiency... totally different from the Xlux.  If I had used this meter without knowing how my plants usually require watering, my plants would be failing in a very short time. Buyers beware...I would not recommend this meter.", "I had high hopes, but like many other reviews said, this thing is just not reliable. I felt like it worked sometimes, but I was always questioning it and ended up testing the soil with my finger anyway. Returned because I just don't think it's consistent enough. Plus I could feel it ripping through roots when inserted into the soil of my plants.", "Amazing being able to discern how wet the soil below the surface of a planter is without having to did it up! This sensor seems to work well, though i'm a  bit astounded at what it considers WET. Easy to use, seemingly accurate, no batteries to replace. I like it and am adjusting my watering schedules accordingly, based on actual facts rather than guessing or using the surface appearance as a guide. Product does exactly what they claim!", "This hygrometer is exactly what I needed. I have killed so many plants due to over or under watering in the past. I wish I had bought this years ago- it\u2019s so helpful. I bought an expensive banana tree and want to take really good care of it, so I bought this thing to help me take care of it. Excellent purchase! Will buy again when needed.", "I have a lot of houseplants and whenever people ask me how I keep from killing them I say that it's all about effective watering and light. If they don't have a water meter like this though, I tell them they need to get one. Sure you can dig a finger into the soil but with so many shapes/sizes/depths of pots this is the only truly accurate way to know when your plant needs water.", "I decided to go ahead and invest in something I thought would be useful and pay off in ensuring by plants survival but the product turned out to be utterly useless. I tested several plants and all of them read dry. Even the green onions I had just watered tested dry. As there are no detailed instructions in box I even referred back to this product page and still got the same unhelpful readings. It was a waste of $11 and now I have a random hunk of plastic at home. Waste of money.", "The meter works and is helping me trim my watering schedule as planned. But the item arrived damaged. The packaging (or the packer) allowed a bend and the probe shaft is kinked and slightly bent in the middle. It does seem to function however. I suppose that the first time I hit a rock or some other obstruction when I sink the probe into the soil it could bend further (if I'm not careful) and break the wires or whatever is inside the tube. The other item in the box was undamaged so no claim has been made.", "seemed to be working great. responsive and accurate. then the tip fell off in a potted plant. cleaned out the stem and put the tip back in, but it never worked right after that. there is a small wire in the stem that needs to make contact with the tip and its unlikely to reassemble it effectively after the tip comes off... so i must return and try a different product.", "Love this tool! I am a new gardener growing from seed. Last year I was overwatering and then underwatering. It was driving me crazy! This meter has been the difference and my tomatoes and peppers are growing nice and healthy.  Like the ease of use, just stick in soil and wait a few mins for the needle to settle and let you know if the plant is wet, moist or dry. No batteries or cords so can take it outside and not worry about it dying on me. Highly recommended!", "Ordered this but it arrived in a plastic padded pouch. The meter's cardboard is thin and somewhat crushed. The spike was bent at a 90 degree angle so returned it. Ordered an identical replacement. It arrived packaged the same way but works perfectly when I used it. Watered the lawn today and later tested the soil. The metered showed the north side was more moist  compared to the south side of the lawn, which is spot-on. It's a keeper!", "I first received a faulty meter. The meter wouldn\u2019t read above the lowest line (dry) even in soil that was just watered. I do a mixture of bottom and top watering for my plants so I know the soil was saturated. I tried it in many areas of the plant and is still read the whole way dry. I was hopeful since it had good reviews so I ordered a replacement. The replacement did the exact same thing. I even had other people try it just in case it was user error, even though I was confident it wasn\u2019t since I\u2019ve been gardening and using other meters for years. To top it all, I returned both products but somehow still got charged for the replacement in the end. So now I paid double for two junky items that will go in the trash.", "Usually I don't comment on reader reviews but to those who wrote that the gauge doesn't work in water:  the description specifically says NOT to put it in water!", "I have two other moisture meters and they each give me a different reading IN THE SAME LOCATION!!  The three readings consisted of \"WET\", \"DRY\", and \"MOIST\". They weren't even in the same ball park.  I wish I could return all 3 of them, but I'm over the return period.  These items are faulty, inaccurate and my plants are suffering because of the lack of consistency. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.", "The plant list on the box is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. \u201cCommon\u201d names I have never come across in an entire career in horticulture. Plants that were recognized on the list were often in the wrong category for media moisture level. Plants that should have been listed, were not. I can\u2019t see how this information is at all helpful to a gardener in the USA. No instructions as to how long to let the probe be in the media for an accurate measurement. The meter itself was inconsistent in readings based on what I could tell based on visual and tactile evidence. I returned this for a refund.", "I got tired of shoving my finger into 10 different pots of soil every other day to check them.  This works really well to help you get an idea of how moist the soil it.  My plants love it since I only water them when they need it now.  It seems accurate and you can measure the moisture at different levels in the soil which is nice.", "This arrived promptly. Unfortunately it is not very accurate. Did a couple of test with it. Clay soil, soaked after a week of rain registers as Low Moist, should of registered at Wet. Sink full of water registers as Low Moist. So it is less reliable than one's own common sense. Made in China, very light weight, you would think it was hollow inside.", "I'm so glad I bought this! I was getting so frustrated that two of my plants are dying when I water when I feel soil and it's dry well turns out according to the chart that's on the box, I'm over watering them cause they're in the dry zone\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f love the chart that breaks down where your plants moisture level should land at for it to flourish. I have zero complaints about meter and recommend all newbies to get this!", "I tried this out on a very dry plant. It read very dry. I then put it in a plant that had been watered well a few hours earlier. It read very dry. I immersed it a little over an inch in a glass of water and it still read dry, although not a dry as the other 2. I think it was a waste of money. It was very easy to read and use but not accurate.", "Furthermore, you can't leave this in the pot, it's only to check it at that moment, which isn't what I wanted. I wanted to be able to leave it in the dirt to know when to water the plant, but if you do that, the metal of the sensor begins to literally rot and flake. I've only ever seen it read between dry and soaking wet", "Put it in a plant pot that had not been watered in five days, and the dial went to 10. Every plant I used it on, said 10. I put it in a plant pot that was in my garage and had not seen water since last August, drier than the Atacama Desert, yet the dial still said \"10\". It says \"Simply insert the moisture meter into soil and you'll get the test result instantly\" either there is more to it than that, or it's junk.", "This product is terrible!  I\u2019ve had plant water meters before which read moisture level as soon as you put the stick in the soil.  Please tell me why it says DRY right after I water?!  Returning item.", "A dud, perhaps? No matter what plant I put it in, whether it was just watered or hadn\u2019t been watered in a week, no matter how long I left it in, what level I had it in...dry. The needle did a minor shimmy when I used it on the just-watered plant...but remained on dry. Obviously not working, but I assume I have a defective product.", "I dont do well with plants. But I had these beautiful monsteras that began to show signs of dying. Crispy leaves and brown spots. Turns out I was under watering,  then I was overwatering! Friend told me about this gadget and sure enough it will keep me from harming my plants. I see new life coming back to these plants", "Lifesaver!  I had to put large rocks in my house plants because my dogs like to eat the dirt & small rocks that I was using before.The difficulty with this - is watering my plants!  It\u2019s hard to tell if the soil is dry or moist, without moving all the rocks \ud83e\udea8!This tells me how moist the soil is, genius!", "I've been on a long search for a very accurate soil moisture meter.  I tried many models and NONE of them provided the accuracy that this one does.  I use it mainly for my houseplants but I'm sure it will work just as well for outdoor/in ground plants.  Seems well made and sturdy.  I highly recommend this model!!!", "Does not work on loamy or chunky soil. I use Kellogg\u2019s brand organic soil products and they all have some chunky bits. I\u2019m working my way to a loamy soil, and have that accomplished in a couple places. This reader is in accurate in both. Seems the soil has to be fine and compact to get a correct reading. I\u2019m returning.", "I received a magnolia plant for mother's day and it came with limited watering instructions.  After weeks of not knowing if I watered too much or not enough decided to purchase a water meter.  This one works perfect, however, I did it too late for the plant.  I will definitely continue to use it to test the soil on any future plants I receive.  Definitely recommend this product.", "Seems to be good quality and fairly accurate as compared to another older meter. Only thing to be aware of is it is delicate. If you try to force it into compact or hard soil it will easily break. I broke one already and this order was a replacement. I now only insert using stem rather than holding onto the head as it is easy to use too much force by pushing it into the soil via the head.", "It\u2019s exactly what I needed. I have a collection of rare houseplants that I would very much like to not die, and this helps with that. Just stick it into the soil slowly, all the way down, then bring it back up. It helps find dry layers where the watering missed, which is great. Just make sure to clean it carefully after use and store it in a place where it won\u2019t get damaged.", "I tried this in about 10 different plants, most of which I just watered the day before.  It said they were all dry.  Dead dry.  I couldn't get the needle to budge no matter how I stabbed the soil.  I had boughten 2 of them, one for me, one for a friend. The other one wouldn't work either.  They are going back!", "Exactly what I was looking for in a moisture meter.  Nothing fancy but something that would work out of the box. And it literally did. Took it out of the box and unwrapped it, put it in one of my plants and the meter worked.  Showed that my plant needed a bit of water which was correct as it was watering day.  I use it on all my plants including the succulents to make sure they don't get overwatered.  I am glad I found this one.", "Works as advertised. While I cannot speak to its accuracy, I can say it seems to be relatively accurate. If you put it in the ground after you water, you will see a higher reading. Put it in a cup of water and see 10/10. So without having tools to independently Calibrate or gauge it\u2019s accuracy, I have to assume it is as advertised.", "I bought this meter based on the thousands of 5* reviews.  Unfortunately, my experience was different.  After about 10 insertions, the tip of the meter broke off in very soft soil.  Amazon sent me a replacement.  However, as soon as I opened the box I knew something was wrong (different from the first meter) when the meter read 4.  It didn't matter if the soil was bone dry or soaking wet, the meter read 4.  I guess if I was willing to try a third time I might actually get one that works and lasts more than one day.  Time to find another manufacturer!", "Got as a Christmas gift for wife.Will update after Christmas about product.Arrived quickly, no damage to box or product inside. Can\u2019t say much else until she uses it.If it\u2019s anything like the other 2 we have, it\u2019s going to work just as advertised, tell you how moist your soil is or isn\u2019t.", "Although I've only had this meter for a few days I really am enjoying it. So easy to use and read. I have many house plants  and find the meter very useful & it seems to be very accurate (I've checked it with a finger test in the soil). I was very impressed with the seller following up on the arrival and my satisfaction plus offing to help if any problems arose. I love good customer service!", "A similar looking meter reads PH, light and other things, but I just wanted to check the moisture in my plants.  I have a bad tendency to over water.  After using this meter, I was surprised at how much I have been over watering.  My plants are already looking much better now that I'm being more restrained.", "The taller one is probably better but not in stock. Once you insert the meter well into the soil, between the leaves and the fact you have to bend down to read it, it\u2019s not too convenient or easy. However, I believe it is accurate. A longer metal would be better, or having the reading part facing upwards.", "I've killed so many plants from not knowing if I over or underwatered.  This product really helps illuminates whether the soil is truly wet or dry, despite what the dirt at the top looks like.  I've grown my plant collection from three to twelve because theyve been growing so absolutely well after knowing the right water amount. *aka Does exactly what I need it to.Apparently this product has a warranty, but I have not needed it yet.", "I used this product today for the first time. I used it on houseplants that I knew to be dry (ish) and it detected that all were dry to a greater or lesser degree. The one plant it showed was least dry did have soil that was damp to the touch about 4 inches down in the soil which is where the tip of the probe was.", "This plant moisture meter has told me my plants were dry since inception. I started to notice decay. I then put my finger in the soil and then I felt the soil was moist!!!!  I am so disappointed with this purchase.  It is garbage.  I would not recommend this unless you want to kill expensive houseplants!", "If you are like me and you want to have a lovely patio garden but you keep killing everything, BUY THIS! Some plant care directions tell you to allow the plant to dry out before watering, but I never knew how to tell what was happening below the top layer of soil (all my plants are in containers). All my friends with green thumbs just seem to have an instinct about what plants need, but I didn\u2019t know if plants were wilting due to over or under watering or sunlight issues. I bought this, and it\u2019s SO easy and accurate. No more guessing about watering needs. Honestly, this little purchase will save you tons because you won\u2019t keep killing plants!", "Maybe its just mine, but this probe has a hard time with the lower moisture levels in my succulent soils.It works fine for my larger plants that have get a weekly watering and the soil stays consistenly damp.If you have an orchid or succulents, this gives me the same readout.  Not sure if it is user error, but I bought this to measure the cactus' soil moisture.", "It barely registers moisture in potting soil unless it is soaking and then it is maybe reading half way. It works better in garden soil. Seems to work well in ground soil that is firmly packed.  I think most people will need this for potted plants to prevent overwatering and it just doesn't work well.", "I bought this water meter, used it on my plants, placing it down in the soil and it seemed to work well. After about a week of use, cleaning the tip with a paper towel each time I used it, the meter stopped working. It now registers everything dry, even after I've watered it, and the gauge doesn't move at all.", "Simple product to use: just stick into the soil and read the moisture content in the meter.  Company provides an 18-month warranty, something unheard off for a $10 item.  Finally, Company provides good communication/notification (through emails) about their product.", "Just days after the 30-day return window closed for this purchase (made in Mar. 2021), the sensor tip came off and remained down in one of the sample holes. Now the inquiry message to the vendor was returned undelivered by Amazon. Just a heads up, gang. Don't hold your breath for any vendor support.", "I used this for my lemon tree, over time the tip begun to determinate, idk if its because of the acidity of the soil I have to use but I feel like it should have been made with that being a possibility in mind and use a different material. Within 1 year the tip looked like it took an aggressive beating.", "I have a Neanthe Bella Palm I keep in my office that I absolutely love that was a gift from a client. It's grown well since I received a few years back. I had issues this past winter overwatering it (yes, I should have known better) that caused a pest problem (fugus gnats...yuck).  I have since replanted in a new pot with fresh soil and added more drainage. Pest problem is gone and I ordered this so I won't make that mistake again. This moisture meter works great determining when and when not to water my little guy.  Definitely recommend purchasing this!", "I had been using the finger test method for checking moisture levels. It clearly wasn't working very well since I had several plants showing signs of overwatering, yet the top few inches of soil felt dry. This has come in handy. I can really tell how much moisture a plant has around its roots without guessing.", "Plugged it into the ground on my first tree, within 5 min of opening the box, it showed WET which was great. I pulled it out and plugged it down again in a different area and it registered DRY. When I pulled it out I noticed the tip was missing. It\u2019s now defective and useless. Buy a better one.", "100% Yes! If you struggle with keeping plants alive or if you have many plants with differing water and light needs, then this is a life saver. Not only does it indicate when it\u2019s time to water (dry etc depending on the plant), but I use it to know how much to water since indoors I use many non draining pots. I water lightly and recheck until it indicates the saturation level I want for that plant. So great I want one for downstairs and upstairs.", "This device didn\u2019t work, mine never gave an accurate reading (always read dry- when the soil was very recently dampened). After researching these devices measure the conductivity of the soil, only slightly accurate in regards to how WET the soil actually is. I\u2019ll trust my sense of touch instead.", "I use it for my large outdoor potted plants and I\u2019m very happy with this moisture sensor.  The difference in moisture from the top couple of inches down to 4-5 inches is significant. I\u2019m saving water from watering less, and figure if I don\u2019t kill one more plant to over watering (which I'm prone to do), that pays for this device!", "I know I can use a chopstick or other method to test my plants' soil, but honestly, this meter is so inexpensive, easy to use and effective that I plan to buy another one. I currently carry this one back and forth to work. Everyone now thinks I have a green thumb and they keep asking me about all my plants! I don't have a green thumb, I have this water meter!", "Saves you from killing your plants due to underwatering as well as from overwatering. Takes all the guesswork out of when to water. I REFUSE to do it the primitive way some amateur gardeners suggest: to plunge your fingers into the soil and scoop up a fistful of dirt. Anyhow even then I wouldn't be able to determine if the soil is sufficiently wet or not. And eyeballing is inaccurate.", "It was rarely used, properly stored and kept clean. It is stuck on \u201cdry\u201d and won\u2019t budge no matter how wet the soil. We used this to monitor house plants and it has broken in less than 2 months.Spend money on a quality product. This felt like junk from the beginning. Do not buy.", "At first the meter worked perfectly. Soon the meter only began to read dry, so I kept watering it. I know nothing about plants but was told this would help a lot, well now my money tree is falling apart from being over watered. As you can see the soil is visibly wet and it still reads dry.", "This thing does not work! I literally just watered a plant and it shows dry. Ibe followed the directions. I have 40 plants and the meter was only showed moisture for 3. Watering day was yesterday for most of my plants. I finger checked the soil, still moist. Waste of money", "Not too sure about this or it\u2019s accuracy. I have a plant that was completely dry, I checked the soil before. I placed the meter and it said it was moist stayed in 4/5. I placed it deeper into the soil and it didn\u2019t budge. I put it into a plant that had just been watered so it was wet and once again it just said moist and stayed in 4/5", "Tried on 3 different houseplant pots and some seedling pots. Never got needle to move higher than a notch above Dry even though plants were recently watered and obviously moist to the eye. Scuffed surface of probe as instructions stated but this did not make any difference. Returned item.", "I found this to not be accurate. It measured Dry for succulents I just watered the evening before. If I were to trust the readings, my plants would be overwatered. Just sticking with my finger method of testing, going forward. I got the same reading with plants that hadn't been watered in over a week, to those watered the night before. Everything reads as \"Dry\".", "This doesn't work at all. I put it in a plant pot that I watered a week or so ago and it showed as completely dry. I put it in a pot that I watered yesterday and it showed as completely dry. I put it a cup of water and it went up a couple of notches but still within \"dry.\"", "I\u2019m not sure how this item is still being sold but it does not work, I have tried in over 5 pots, all different levels of moisture and it reads the same regardless. I was able to get it to read the first level of moist one time and the soil was definitely far closer to wet than moist, don\u2019t waste your money.", "I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this item; half of which said it didn't work and the rest insisting the bad reviewers just didn't know how to use it properly. Personally, the meter measured absultely nothing for me. It did the same thing just lying there in the box that it did while in use. So the directions on the box definitely aren't getting the thing to work. I'm guessing half of the sensors are broken. I don't recommending risking the purchase.", "Reading the mixed reviews, I think there might just be a quality control / consistency error. I have another soil meter that I thought was off, so I bought this one to cross check. I checked before + after watering my plants that needed it and ended up having to shove my finger in to feel the soil because I couldn\u2019t trust either meter. This one kept reading \u201cdry\u201d even after i thoroughly watered many of my plants. I tried wiping it with a rough cloth like instructed (or fine sandpaper like many suggest to get the metal oxide off) and nothing. For a $13 soil meter, I expected at least one that somewhat worked /:", "Love this tool. If you have plants, do yourself a favor and get one or two of these. You just stick it right into the soil and it tells you the moisture level right away. The back of the box gives you a guide for many different plants, which is nice. Doesn\u2019t display all. Overall, 10/10", "I became very reliant on this, and three weeks into using it I overwatered my plants because it registered them as \"dry\" when they were moist. I tested it by putting it in a cup of water, which was indicated as \"dry.\" Now it works very inconsistently so am ordering a different brand today.", "I haven\u2019t done any testing to verify the accuracy, but I use it for houseplants and when the pot is dry, it shows dry and when the pot is wet, it shows it as wet. It\u2019s convenient because I don\u2019t have to pick every pot up to see how heavy it is.I\u2019d buy again and recommend.", "This is singlehandedly one of the best purchase for my plants that I\u2019ve ever made. Before I got this meter, I was gauging the soil\u2019s moisture with my fingers, but my plants always ended up dying on me. And it wasn\u2019t until I purchased this moisture meter that I realized just how much I was overwatering my plants!It\u2019s easy to use and now it\u2019s a staple for me. I just insert it gently into the pot and voila! A perfect reading. It\u2019s saved my plants who are still alive and even helped me revive some of the plants I nearly killed!I would highly recommend this to anyone with indoor plants. :)", "I bought a house plant that I put gravel over the dirt and this makes it really easy to measure the moisture level in different parts of the pot since this particular plant (an aglaonema) doesn't need to be watered very often. The display is easy to read and as long as you use it correctly it works (easy). Very glad I bought it.", "Before using this moisture meter I was watering my vegetable garden to often. Now I only water my bins when the meter reads low at 2\u201d down. I only need to water half as often as before I got this meter. I would never be without one again.This really saves on the water bill. Love it.", "This is my first moisture meter.  After all these many years I finally purchased one.  I love it!!  My neighbor found out I had one and she bought this also.  It really works great and I am so glad I have it or I would still be under watering or over watering.  Now I get it right!!", "For the last 20 years I have had a Moisture Meter that finally died.  I ordered this one due to its large # of positive reviews but I received it this morning and when I used it the first time I realized that due to the small size of the meter and the shorter stalk than the one I had before that it was hard to read.  I'm sure it works right but I would suggest getting a larger one for convenience.", "I loved this device because I prevented me from overwatering my plants. However, I\u2019m sad to report, that after 7 months it no longer works.  I\u2019m not sure why it stopped working but the guage doesn\u2019t move.Since it doesn\u2019t take batteries I anticipated it lasting a very long time.  This is discouraging \ud83d\ude14(Photo of it in moist soil)", "The first one I ordered was dead on arrival. I got a replacement because I was still within the return window. The second one worked briefly, but then the tip broke off. I wasn\u2019t being aggressive with it - I guess it is just a bit fragile? Now it is broken and I\u2019m outside the return window.

I clearly have been over watering some of them which is why they aren't doing the greatest...but now this shows when they are dry. I would definitely order again.", "This is a handy tool for the not so \u201cgreen thumbs\u201d in the world (like me who kills a cactus). It\u2019s easy to use and read where all you do is stick it in the soil and it lets you know how moist it is. Cleaning is a just as easy where you wipe it off and store it away. Now I don\u2019t have too worry if I\u2019m watering too much or too little.", "Broke quickly. This worked great for a while and then suddenly stopped working. Needle won\u2019t move whether I place it in dry soil or freshly watered soil.", "This didn't work. It'd record no moisture on every plant until I purposely put it in one I'd just watered heavily. Then after that it'd record tons of moisture on every plant I'd already checked it on. Washing and letting it dry for several minutes between each check sometimes helped but only part of the time. I returned it.", "Great product for watering plants in the summer, especially your hanging baskets. It is somewhat difficult to judge if they are dried out. This productWorks on everything and keeps your plants looking great all summer and fall! It even works well throughout the entire year.", "The device itself is very poorly packaged with only a thin, flimsy plastic bag around the item inside the box. Likely damaged enroute, or never worked properly at manufacture. At any rate, the meter read \"3\" on unpacking and did not change when inserted into the soil of a house plant that had been watered on the previous day. Returned for credit to use on another manufacture's model.", "This was a lifesaver for my plants. After I started using it I realized I was really underwatering some plants. I know some people use the finger in the dirt method but when you have dozens and dozens of plants this is just easier and way more accurate. I highly recommend this.", "I bought one and it didnt work, sent it back for a replacement and that one worked for a week. Absolutely horrible and useless", "The product itself seems to be made well, and I think it works. I'm trying not to overwater some really dry succulents that I just received in the mail.Unfortunately, the packaging/quality control leaves a lot to be desired. The product's most important part was jammed through the box and exposed inside the Amazon bag. I thought that the listing of plants on the box was really interesting, but unfortunately could not read it because a sticker was covering it and someone partially ripped it off.", "Thought I could tell if plants needed water. Turns out, sometimes I was wrong. Fine to guess on some plants, but others are more sensitive to overwatering. No more overwatering my snake plants or succulents. Super easy to use and read with a gage like OS gas gauges. Good value.", "This is awesome! Easy to use. No batteries needed and always ready. I know one can manually test the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil \ud83d\ude0a but this is a great alternative and goes deeper than my finger can reach lol. I bought one for me and one for my niece. We recommend!", "I love this product! I thought it was battery powered, but I love it because it\u2019s NOT! So easy to use and very accurate. It helped me save one of my plants because I didn\u2019t realize it was sitting in water! Love this thing, I might even gift it to my other plant lover friends!", "I've followed the instructions of how to read/use it, but its reading of the soil of my plants never changes, regardless of how long before/after watering I check.It may be that my plants, all being small in <7\" pots, are too shallow for this type of device, but anyways, it just didn't work for me.", "I just spent a fortune replacing my 20 year old Austrian Pine that croaked. To ensure I have the moisture level correct I use the manual method of digging next to the root ball about 6-8 inches deep to get a reading. I ALSO use the XLUX T10 and the readings have been dead on to my digging approach. I'm about ready to use ONLY the T10 and forget all this digging. Works fantastic and would highly recommend! Item was shipped and arrived exactly as stated. Great seller as well!", "The 1st one I received was defective. It has so many positive reviews that I decided to risk investing more of my time in this product. I'm glad I exchanged this meter rather than requesting a refund. It's the only soil moisture meter I've encountered that works well enough to rely on.", "Awesome addition to any Garden and a most have for Plant Lovers who have a variety of Plants. It allows me provide the correct amount of water as the Moist Measurements are very accurate. The Product was Recommended by Woodley Home and Garden Center located in Columbia SC.", "I purchased this product as a gift for my husband in December. We took it out to use it on new plants last week and the guage just shakes and will not go above dry.  I tried it in a pot of soil that I soaked with water and it still does not move.  I was going to return it but was told that the return window ended January 31.  I thought things bought for the holiday had a longer return window.", "A picture is worth a thousand words. Water is running right next to gauge. Gauge reads dry \ud83e\udd23. Don\u2019t buy it if you like your plants and don\u2019t want to destroy them by overwatering", "I purchased this moisture meter at the end of Dec 2020, it was wonderful and worked perfectly. My rubber tree was looking sad, so after I watered I wanted to make sure it reached all the roots. The meter kept saying dry, even though the soil was obviously wet and sticking to it. I tried another plant I recently watered, nothing registered on the meter. So when you buy, you also run the risk of it suddenly not working four months later.", "It seems to work but I don\u2019t know with what accuracy.  Dry soil reads dry and moist soil, moist.Someone asked for pictures of the back of the box as they had thrown theirs away.  Here you go!  Print is smaill and box is damaged so it may be a little hard to read.", "Pretty accurate. I don't overeater anymore. Yes you can gently water while it is in the dirt. I use it so that I can watch the hands move and I can stop before it reaches wet. Avoid stones as that can  damage it. Don't put in water as directed. User friendly. Recommend", "When I first opened the device and put it into one of my indoor potted plants, the meter did seem to move. However, after about an hour, the meter was all the way to \u201cdry\u201d, which was not the case when I felt the soil with my finger. Now after having it for a few weeks, I can say that it does not read the moister of the soil at all. I can stick it into soaking wet soil, right after thoroughly watering the plant, and the meter doesn\u2019t move. Get one that requires batteries and gives you an actual reading, those seem to be the only legit moister meters out there.", "Unless a plant is freshly watered, the needle remains at 0-1 (dry), even when a finger in the soil can feel the moisture. When freshly watered, it goes up to all of 3-4. I tried it on 20 different plants. You're better off testing the soil with your finger. Waste of money.", "I planted lots of seeds this spring. Had never started my vegetables with seeds before. I've always found it hard to figure out how much to water plants.Over or under watering weakens plants making them subject to failure. This moisture meter made the growth process so successful. I had so many good plants I gave lots of them to friends and family. The meter easily indicates if there is enough water or too much. Since the plants have moved outdoors, I still use it to determine if the plants are moist enough.", "At first I loved this tool, checking all my plants constantly. Over time, though, I started finding that it really only reads clay soils accurately. Any kind of sandy or highly organic soils will read dry, no matter how soaked they are.I wouldn't bother with this one; just water when the plants look like they need water and try to find a good rhythm.", "I routinely over water my plants and kill them. This product is saving their lives! Just stick it in the dirt and it will tell you the moisture level. You might be surprised that the dirt looks dry but it is in fact moist. Requires no batteries and super easy to use.", "I overwatered a plant and decided to order this, I would normally just stuck my finger into the soil to check. I will be going back to this method.This thing insists that all of my plants are dry or on the very lowest end of moist. I tried checking the soil immediately after watering and it still showed that it was just barely moist. What a waste of money, I should have stuck with my free method. Hopefully I can get a refund.", "Really useful little gadget! Seems fairly accurate and works very quickly, the little needle/gauge will move and show you the moisture level in seconds. Super light, convenient and easy to use, especially for the price! I think this will be very helpful in preventing overwatering, and I only wish I had bought it sooner!", "I already had a 2-prong moisture/pH meter that was hard to push into the soil without breaking plant  roots and possibly breaking the meter itself. Since I only need the moisture reading most of the time, I decided to purchase this single-prong moisture meter.  I have been using it for about two weeks. It accurately measures the moisture, and  I am much happier with the single prong meter than my 2-prong meter.", "This is fine for potted plants. However if you have clay soil or rocks, and even if you drill a hole first, you will risk breaking the tip off, rendering the unit useless. This has happened three times and it won't happen a fourth for me. I'll just use a hand shovel.", "I looooove this moisture meter!! It\u2019s exactly what I needed. Nothing crazy fancy, simple, easy to use. Huge help with avoiding over watering my houseplants that don\u2019t have drainage holes in their pots and for my plants that are picky about soil moisture. Absolutely would recommend!", "Worked great for a very short time.  Clearly this product has a quality issue. It stopped working less than a month after it was delivered. I only used it for my succulent containers so can\u2019t understand how it could quit working. Try another brand. This one is a waste of money.", "I noticed this was staying all my plants were \u201cdry\u201d, even some I watered yesterday and were clearly moist. So I decided to test it out. I watered my plant adequately, waited a few minutes, then tested it. It still read \u201cdry\u201d. Very disappointed as I read lots of positive reviews.", "It's a good looking tool but when it comes to actually reading the moisture it is not very good!If you rely solely on this you will kill your plants! The soil will still be damp not even Close to drying up and the device has the audacity to say dry, needs water \ud83d\ude44I'm sticking to my square one that sometimes  reads PH", "I am pretty happy happy with this simple device.  No set-up.  No frills.  Push it in the soil and it tells you whether you need to water or not.  There is also a guide with it to give you guidelines for various plants.  No batteries needed.  Simple.  I have gifted it to two other people.  So far.", "My meter stopped working after 9 months. I will dip it into very wet soil and can never get it past the 4 or 5 marking. I think it's no longer calibrated. I no longer have my warranty email from the company, but if possible would like to contact them asking for help.", "I have used this device on a large number of potted indoor and outdoor plants  for 10 months now.  It appears to function without flaw.  The gauge reading correlates very well with subjective measures of moisture in my plant pots, such as hefting the pots and feeling the soil.  The beauty of it is its rapidity.  I can assess the need for water in all of my potted plants in mere minutes, and feel confident in the results.", "I kill plants.  Watering has always been a challenge for me.  How much is too much?  Not enough?  How can you tell?  This meter is a plant-saver for sure.  Stick it into the soil and I instantly know if I need to water a plant or not.  Love it!  I'm going to buy more for gifts.  It's made that much of an impression on me!", "Very easy to use. Told me immediately which of my plants needed water. I can\u2019t find my Goldfish Plant on the lists, but I read about how and when to water so I should be good. I had one of these like 40 years ago and like this one, it works great!!! Highly recommend.", "Unfortunately I throughly the box as I believed that something this simple would work with no issues. But upon following the instructions and watching YouTube videos to make sure I was doing it correctly the device did not move or trickle after the instrument was wiped down and then put into soil. Wasn\u2019t sure if there was a time frame I was supposed to wait so I gave it atleast 10 minutes with no results. I assume I got a faulty one right off the bat.", "This meter worked ok, didn't seem very accurate, but you get a ballpark reading.  It lasted almost a year before the bottom tip broke off.", "I haven't used other moisture meters prior to this one, so I cannot make comparisons. I can say that this one seems to be well made. It isn't flimsy or cheap feeling. It's easy to read. My plants were suffering to overwatering, which I did not realize until I got this meter.", "Why did I wait so long to get one of these. I always overwater and kill my plants. I\u2019ve learned, after getting this, even though it feels dry on top, that doesn\u2019t mean it needs water as this tells me there\u2019s plenty down below! Save your plants and get one.", "Arrived in good order and quickly. Simple use, insert into pot and read from dry to moist to wet. Wish the unit would show the results a little longer. Pull it out and the reading is gone. Never the less it is going to save me from over or under watering.", "The unit has precisely 0 accuracy. I tested it in very damp soil. Bone dry, it reported! I stuck it into some muck. Dry, it reported. Finally, I took a terry cloth and soaked it with water. It was able to get a moisture reading from that. But testing the cloth three times in a row in rapid succession, each reading was wildly different. This is unscientific garbage.", "This is the key to container gardening success!  Many a plant's life has been saved by using this to check on the soil before watering.  I found I had been causing problems by watering too much.  I tried another brand of moisture sensors from the garden store and it (and its replacement) seemed to stop working right away, but this is the one to get.  Lasted much longer.", "I tend to water all my houseplants the same way -  once a week. A few were looking a bit wilted, so I watered a little more during the week. Well, thanks to this meter, I discovered that I was OVER watering...slowly killing my plants. I've been using is product for about a month. It's simple to use...especially in pots with compact roots...the single prong makes it easy. The meter gives instant easy-to-read results and even includes a watering guide (plants zoned by moisture need) on the box. Inexpensive and an 18-mo warranty. I am happy with this product and would recommend.", "Not really sure if this product is designed to be used to measure moisture in turf grass but thats what Im using it for. I dont think the numbers on the dial really mean anything for grass, but it will at least give you a baseline reading which you can then monitor for dryness or moistness.", "Have had this for 9 months, but really rarely used it,  although I noticed it never showed any moisture in house plants.?  Began to use it more and for potted outdoor plants and vegetables.  Never any moisture.  Even inserted it into a glass of water and needle barely moved.  I had a different one for many years and always worked until it just died of old age.  Not sure if I can return it, but will look for something else.", "Is nice to be able to more adequately care for our indoor plants to prevent overwatering and drying them out. We have a variety of plants, some requiring more frequent watering than others, so this takes the guess work out of trying to figure out which ones to water every day. Can't get much easier than sticking it in the soil and watching where the needle points.", "I bought this hoping I could glance at it and know if I needed to water my plants. Not the case the gauge rarely moves. This might be just my experience but something tells me it's not. I would not recommend easier just to stick your finger in the dirt", "This product was OK. The dial would sometimes get \u201cstuck\u201d past dry or stuck past wet. The meter was off and i would have to tap it a little or wipe the tip a few times for it to work properly again.Its not something I would buy again or recommend. For the price, I expected it to be better but now it\u2019s just working sometimes", "I changed my review from 1 to 5 stars as I thought it was defective since the needle never moved. I tapped it quite hard and it jostled it and now it works and I'm glad because this will ensure I'm not messing up my veg. Great product, worth it for sure.", "Barely a month out of the box and the meter is barely registering moisture. Just soaked my geranium overnight in a bucket of water, so the water is sopping wet this morning. stuck the meter into the soil and you might expect a top wet reading, yes? It shows right on the line between dry and moist, ie- very dry. Not worth the investment.", "I used it to determine the moisture in my plants for determining if i need to water or not.  It does not work.  I purchased March 20, 2020.  I keep putting it in different pots, dry and wet and the meter is stuck between 3 - 4 on the meter.  I am going to check to see if i can return it", "I had my doubts about ordering this because the price is so reasonable, and some of the previous reviewers  said it doesn\u2019t work properly. I\u2019m here to tell you that it absolutely does work properly and accurately if you follow the few simple directions I\u2019m extremely happy with this purchase! It\u2019s taken all the guesswork out of watering my house plants.", "This gadget is great.  I wish i would have known about this years ago.  Woman in my garden club has been using similar device for over 30 years.  Now hopefully i wont kill so many houseplants w/ kindness by accidentally over-watering them!  This device is so helpful!", "My pointer finger says thanks! No more having to stick my finger down in the dirt & get my nail filled with dirt to check my plants. This thing is amazing and I cannot believe I didn't know they existed. Any plant parent should have this!!! I have been recommending it to everyone. I love my moisture meter!", "This worked like a charm and was very easy to use and accurate right out of the box. Reads dry/moist/wet and simple to just stab into plant container or garden ground.  I\u2019d certainly recommend if your after simplicity and only want moisture content.", "Received in timely manner and in great conditition, but when I tried it out on plants where it it obvious the soil isn't dry--  gave me a dry reading every time.  For one plant that was obviously dry--  gave me a \"moist\" reading.  I don't recommend.", "This thing is a life saver for me at least, maybe not so for my plants. You can still be a horrible plant parent even with this wand. But still this wand is amazing!! I like to go around at stick it in my plants just to see how dry it is at top or wet on the bottom. Good luck!! So worth the purchase!!", "I used it to check the moisture my house plants. All read bone dry. I watered them all, waited an hour and measured again and it still read bone dry. Put in on the lawn right after sprinklers came on - dry again.", "I have a ton of houseplants, and the meter that I've had for about 20 years finally bit the dust. I was happy to find this one, it's much nicer and very sturdy. Looks like it might last me 20 more years, which means that it will outlive me!", "Every year my palm plant almost died indoors during the winter when I had to care for it inside.  With this device along with a plant light, it has actually grown new branches.  I know exactly when to water.  One of the best instruments I've ever used.", "I have to say this is the most favorite thing I have ever bought on Amazon!  I have bought thousands of merchandise here and I hit the jackpot on this one! No more guessing if my little plants are thirsty and having to stick my finger in the soil and have to wash my hands after.There is a absolutely FREE 18 month warranty on this, can't beat that. Thank you..", "I don't know, guys, I used this product as directed but the reading only outputs the correct information maybe 20% of the time. I've tested with freshly watered soil, completely dry soil, damp soil, etc and this thing doesn't seem to know what to make of it all. I trust the finger test more than I trust this. At least it was cheap.", "Takes the guess work out of watering plants.  Easy to use, instant readings. I've noticed that checking a plant in different spots will give slightly different readings. And definitely different readings from one plant to the next. In my opinion the tester seems very accurate.", "I bought this for my Monstera because it\u2019s getting so big and its hard to tell if the soil is wet.  I just stick this in the soil and it tells me if it\u2019s dry, moist, or wet on a sliding scale.  It\u2019s really accurate and I definitely recommend if you just need that extra okay to let you know it\u2019s okay to water!", "I have a habit of either under watering or overwatering plants to the point I kill them all. So I've been keeping check on the soil in my spider plant that I just bought. I'm not sure if it's accurate or not, but I'm attempting to use it to water instead of always guessing and things dying. We shall see how this goes.", "THIS LITTLE METER IS A LIFE SAVER.  I HAVE JUST STARTED GROWING SUCCULENTS AND WOULD HAVE KILLED ALL OF THEM WITHOUT THIS WATER METER.  THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS SINCE THE PART YOU READ IS STRAIGHT IT IS HARD TO READ, FIND ONE THAT IS TILTED AND YOU WILL BE HAPPIER.  FINE FOR SHORT  SUCCULENTS BUT HARD TO READ WHEN IN A LARGE POTTED PLANT.", "Was misled by Amazon reviews that this product received over 4.5 Stars !!!!!Product never worked, tried several different pots, plants & techniques, IT DOES NOT WORK !!!! Gone past the deadline for returns, so I have to \"eat\" the costs!!!", "I used my moisture meter for the first time today. It seemed to be accurate. The only problem I had was that as soon as the meter is pulled from the soil, the reading is lost. You have to read it while still in the soil. A few of my plants make that hard.", "Life changing when it comes to watering your plants....  No more guessing.  A plant I was watering regularly apparently only needs watered every 6 weeks.  This hydrometer saved the life of my Fiddle Leaf Fig.  Wish I'd bought one sooner.  Have already bought another for my daughter.", "Easy to use, accurate and makes watering a breeze. Turns out I'd been overwatering two big plans for years...ugh...but no more. This tool is sturdy and a snap to read -- no digital dials to fuss with, the needle gives you an immediate read. Love!", "Super easy to use! Had to buy a few moreMake sure you don\u2019t leave it in the pot, mine broke that way. Only use it when you want to check soil, wipe soil off, and store it somewhere safe.Makes being a plant parent beyond helpful\ud83c\udf31", "Broke the first time I used it.  Probably good for houseplants but, I needed help with new trees.  I could easily read the dial at arm's length. San Antonio Landscaping explained this area has high mineral levels in the soil which causes conflicting moisture readings on the dial. Good price for use with houseplants and will keep your hands clean.", "This meter works perfectly.  I have certain plants that need to be watered when the top 2\" of soil is dry and others that prefer even deeper dryness.  This does the trick.  I use the little bag it comes in to wipe it down to create the friction they speak of.", "This really changed the game when it comes to testing your plants soil! I can tell the difference in the overall quality of my plants now since this gives me an accurate reading on when a plant needs to be watered or not (no more overwatering, yay!).  Very easy to read, and comes with awesome tips for soil suggestions for various plants. \ud83d\udc96", "The idea is awesome, but unless I just watered it it will always say dry, even when I can feel plenty of moisture with my fingers.Testing a freshly watered plant will make the meter go halfway.  Wait a few hours and it stays in the dry.", "My Grandfather had one of these 60 years ago and showed me how to use it to water raised bed garden vegetables perfectly. This device uses no wasteful batteries and let\u2019s me know when to water and how effective any one watering is. A must have!", "This turned me into a green thumb! All my indoor plants are very happy with my purchase. I don\u2019t over water them anymore. Make sure you take good care of it and don\u2019t throw it around. Do not put it in water to test it. It\u2019s made for SOIL! Clean the tip off after each testing and you should be fine", "I like to have decorative mulch/moss/rocks around my plants so it is hard to tell if the soil is wet underneath. This thing is amazing for checking is the soil is dry, its super lightweight and feels like there is nothing to it - the probe is long enough to reach deep into the soi.", "I am a relatively new plant mom, only been taking care of my indoor plants for about 5 months now. For me it was really hard to gauge how often each plant needed to be watered. I have maybe 12 different kinds of plants, and they all drink different amounts of water at different speeds. This made watering a huge guessing game for me. This moisture sensor has changed everything!! I no longer have to guess when my plants need water, I just pop the sensor into the soil and it gives you an automatic moisture reading. I've been using this for about a month now and all my plants are thriving!!", "This works great and seems to be very consistent.  I don't depend on it entirely to water, but there's been a number of times that I wasn't sure what was going on with a plant and this cleared it up for me.  Very happy with this, especially for the price.", "Now that I look there are lots of people with similar problems.  How did this get 4 stars?", "Got product in the mail, stuck it in soil, needle did not move. Stuck it in a different pot, needle remains still at \"dry\". These pots both had damp soil. Either way, I expected a tool to measure within seconds like I can feel with my own fingers how deep down the soil is damp or dry. If I have to wait half an hour to get a reading, I don't need this tool. My finger will do just fine. I have over 50 plants.", "I followed instructions and did NOT leave it in the soil, wiped clean after use. Even then after the first couple uses it stopped giving me accurate readings. I'd water deeply and then use this to see if it registers a reading, but it kept saying soil was dry.", "This would be perfect for new plant parents.I purchased this because I recently bought new houseplants that are harder to determine if I\u2019m watering them enough or not because they\u2019re so huge. Now, no more sticking my fingers in the pots.", "We have finally found a way to know for sure if our plants need to be watered.  This simple, inexpensive little gadget has made life so much easier.

So 5 stars for mine but only - star since the other I bought at the same time doesn\u2019t work at all. Do that equals 50/50 chance you get one that works .", "This little gem is going to seriously improve my plant care game. Tested it in numerous types and sizes of pot, soil types, and on plants that were just watered and those that really needed a drink. Everything added up. Very glad I made the purchase.", "This is exactly what I needed for all id my plants.  I love it because I have several different pots that all have different draining times so even with the same plants, I dont over/under water each one. The gauge is easily readable and can measure moisture quickly when transferred from one plant to another. I would recommend this to any plant enthusiast!", "I bought this because of the good reviews and because I was overwatering some succulents I have, so I thought it would help me determine if the soil was completely dry. It seemed decently accurate before it broke, but now it is worthless. There wasn't anything I did that could have made it break, I only used it for my house plants -- it is just made cheaply.", "Life-saver, for realz. I've always been terrible at judging how much moisture my plant soil has, and as a result, the survival rate of my indoor plants is low. But not anymore! I mean, it's still low, but it's much higher than it was.", "Doesn\u2019t seem to work properly. Never shows wet after watering plants. TrieD in several plants", "This moisture meter is not accurate!! Such a waste of time and money. I tested it as soon as I got it. I grabbed a clear plastic cup, filled it with soil, and stuck the meter in. I can clearly see that the soil is sopping wet, and yet, the moisture meter reads at a 3..... 3 is supposed to be DRY. I am no soil moisture expert, but I think if it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s not dry.... \ud83d\ude44", "Works great. Love that it doesn\u2019t need batteries and is easy to read. I watered my fiddle leaf two days ago so its reading of \u201cwet\u201d Is accurate. Too bad you\u2019re not supposed to leave in soil though, it\u2019s why I got it in the first place.", "The First time I used it, it did not register; began to worry.  After trying different plants several times was ready to give up.  Then, it indicated!!  Ever since, has been right on.I am guessing is that the moisture needs a while to move up the rod before registering on the meter.  Almost a prime.  Anyway has been working immediately since.  Use it once a week.", "I found that most of my plants still read \"dry\" despite being watered that same day.  It would read correctly on plants I had watered within the hour at least!  Might be more useful for pots that dont have drainage but it really isn't going to give me any fine details on if a plant is still a little damp or overly dry.  I thought this would save me time, but trying to read the dial is hard as the font is so tiny.Overall, just stick to the finger method.", "It work well.  Accuracy is not important to me.  I just wanted an indication if I\u2019ve overwatered my sensitive plants. It works well for that purpose.  I bought three so you can see I\u2019m sold on this moisture meter. It\u2019s easy to read.", "Once used the dial is not very accurate. Would rather pay more money and purchase a device that was more accurate. The list of plants that come on the box for reference did not contain some common household plants. Disappointed in this device.", "Mine was broken out of the box (I returned for refund from Amazon). I could tell right when I opened it that it was a piece of garbage. It registered no difference in moisture between bone dry cactus soil and freshly watered moist soil (both barely caused the needle to move). Before sending it back, I decided to stick it in water for laughs ... it told me the cup of water was \"Dry\" (... almost made it to \"Moist\" though lol). Don't waste your $$$", "I was constantly over watering my plants but using this device we recognize exactly when my plants need water.", "This was recommended to me by a plant friend and I use it multiple times a day now.

The first one I was sent didn\u2019t work at all but the replacement did!", "This thing quit working after less than 3 months. I had to replace it with another from my local hardware. I would like to return it but unfortunately do not have the packaging. The meter just quit moving. I purchased this in hopes of properly nurturing my Fiddle Leaf Fig. I am glad I noticed because the plant was being overwatered which is detrimental to most varieties.", "Junk. See photo.

Junk.", "My reason for the low star is this isn\u2019t sturdy at all!! I\u2019m not a gardener. I barely use this thing but decided to test some plants before watering with the season change and it snapped in 1/2!!!! I\u2019ve had it about 4 months. It\u2019s been used approximately 6 times. The ground wasn\u2019t even dry as you can tell from the dirt on the stem. I\u2019d recommend looking elsewhere for a sturdier one.", "It worked pretty well until the tip broke off last week. The box says it has an 18 month replacement warranty from seller, so hopefully they will honor the warranty. Amazon says the return window closed Aug. 2020 so that contradicts the replacement warranty stated on the box.Photo shows the broken meter in wet soil registering dry.The company sent me a replacement, which I appreciated, but it broke the first day I tried it.

Easy to use and durable enough for most garden use. Does tend to read low in some very loose soil compared to a more expensive meter, but otherwise is fine.", "I wanted to love this thing. It seems well built, wasn't expensive, and is easy to read at a glance, but mine always reads dry. Even if I can feel the moisture in the soil with my hand, regardless of depth. It can't be accurate.", "Tried on 5 different house plants.  Every reading said it as at the lowest \"dry\".  Then proceeded to water one plant very well.  Waited a couple minutes. Tried again and no difference, said it was the driest reading.  Got a dud.", "Very helpful. I was watching my sisters place and noticed her leaves kept falling off. In picture attached you can see the soil is too moist and likely caused root rot. Now she wants one.I was skeptical of the meters claiming 3-in-1 functionality with mixed reviews. This serves its primary function.", "Very grateful for the Jeff Jones review, his review made the use and understanding of this moisture sensor a lot easier and less complicated.

I have a large fern with a deep pot that this meter kept saying was \"dry\" so I kept watering it, until the fern started to look poorly. I ended up taking the plant out to see what was going on, and the soil was sopping wet...despite this meter saying \"dry\". I put it directly into the sopping wet root ball and it still said \"dry\". I chucked this meter out and repotted the plant. Hopefully it recovers.", "Wish I\u2019d had this sooner for checking all my many houseplants. I pretty much watered them all on the same schedule.

I've been judging the dryness of my plants by eye for years now, so I saw this item as more of a \"for fun\" tool. And while it is fun to use, this really helped me figure out how moist the soil was below the visible surface layer of soil - especially in pots without drainage holes. I think I've been slightly overwatering my plants for a long time, and hopefully, this tool will prevent me from continuing to do so.

I am tech savvy so this thing shouldn't be as hard as it is to simply mount the doorbell to the mount. I just put my return in and was just frustrated all around. To get a new one would take almost a week. I decided to take a breath and a dab. I sat down and closely looked at the backing and the mount. YOU HAVE TO put alot of effort into sliding the mount on. Once you closely look at how the inserts go in line it up and push REALLY HARD sliding the doorbell down. It will slide and lock into place. It shouldn't be this hard to put on and I can see why people are leaving poor reviews. Trust me on this though and don't give up!UPDATE: day 2 and so far so good. I've realized the reason for it being so hard to put the mount on, its to make it VERY sturdy when the doorbell is attached. I've read a review talking about this being easy to steal and I would have to disagree. The door bell isn't going anywhere unless someone takes a hammer to it. The picture quality is really good, the picture I uploaded to this review doesn't compare to the live feed view on my iPhone. This doorbell comes with an \"armed\" and \"disarmed\" mode so when you're not wanting 100 notifications because of birds flying by your doorbell you can disarm and when you leave the house or go to sleep you can arm, I found this convenient.UPDATE#2: Its been over a month now and no problems whatsoever! I went out and bought a 128GB flash drive to put into the module and now my recordings are being saved straight to that. This makes life a lot easier when accessing stored clips and transferring that data to a PC. The doorbell is still nice and tight and working like a charm. For the price you cant really go wrong with this doorbell combo. I suggest purchasing the combo and not the stand alone doorbell itself unless you already have a module in your home.", "A few years ago I was excited to see that BLINK had a doorbell announced at CES so I committed to a multi-camera setup. After it became apparent it wasn't being released, I purchased a RING doorbell and subscription plan begrudgingly. The minute I saw the pre-order for this, I instantly grabbed one. Excited to have everything in one ecosystem, the anticipating and re-excitement from years ago was there. During the waiting period I realized someone pointed out, which at the time was NOT listed on the pre-order page, that you need a Sync-2 module to save the footage/rings. I had a spare but it could have been annoying. Fast forward to today when I received it. It looks beautiful and is a slim profile but the mounting bracket is an absolute joke. 2 shallow screws and no thumbail screw to lock the device in, this could easily be ripped out of the wall within 2 seconds. Combine that with the amount of pressure needed to lock this device into place, theres no doubt in my mind that after a year of changing the batteries some of these small clip/brackets on the plate will indeed snap. The image quality is way too HDR and totally blown out by the sun and bright daylight in the sky, creating a darkness on the face of whoever rings the bell which surprise, kind of defeats the purpose. Lastly, the fact that Amazon did NOT have the mount was the cherry on top. The email they sent later allowed us to order the corner mount free of charge, but inside the blink app it states that it should come with a couple different mounting plate options which it did not. So all in all, I prefer the Blink ecosystem to most and physically this doorbell is great but for something in R&D for 3+ years you definitely dropped the ball on the easiest pieces of the puzzle, especially for a company that owns RING which has an excellent mounting package in the box.", "I got this and just mounted it. I will say that the instructions are not very detailed but being tech oriented I was able to figure everything out. I added the blink app and connected the sync 2 module up using the app instructions which were fine. I did buy a 256gb usb for internal storage which was detected in the app. Once the sync module was up I added the batteries to the camera but left the back off. In the app you add the device as a doorbell and follow the setup. Once done I took the back outside and started to mount it. Prior to mounting you have to leave a small space on the side so you can put the cover on. In my case I left a little on the left. Mine is mounted on the trim which is on a corner so I did use 2\u201d screws with the same thickness as the ones provided and also took a little clear weather caulk to give it as seal. Don\u2019t cover the contacts on the back. The longer screws hopefully with deter someone from stealing it but my neighbors has been up for months. These screws were long enough to get to the wood door frame. I did change the 10sec delay to 15 so less pics are taken as we are coming and going. Quality looked good on a cloudy day so I\u2019ll have to see how night is as well. So far I like it. We shall see how the battery does. I\u2019m adding the fact that once the 30 day trial ended my local storage took over; however, not having the sub takes away the ability to delete more than one at a time. That\u2019s ridiculous", "UPDATE 2: Bought 2 more on sale Black Friday. At this point I'm too heavily invested in Blink to totally toss the thousands of dollars I've spent on Blink. I like the Doorcam for the money. The wide angle is different and applicable for my setup at another house. Image quality is good although I will say on one of my doorcams the image is blurry on the left side. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28The sound settings need adjustment. They have since added a ringer volume since my last review. This ringer volume doesn't change the volume your phone puts out when it notifies you all that much. The speaker volume controls how loud the doorbell chime is AND the speaker volume when you talk. This is counterintuitive. The ringer volume should control the chime volume. If you turn down the speaker volume when someone presses the doorbell yes it lowers the volume but when you try to talk the volume for that is also low. They can easily fix that.TRIAL PERIOD ISSUE: If you buy 1 camera and hook it up you get a 30day free trial giving you access to the original features offered which is why I bought this system before they bait n switched everyone but if you buy more like I did and hook them up at the same time because you want to secure your stuff your trial period is still 30days.So I have figured out and it's somewhat of an inconvenience is to hook up each camera after the trial period so you get your 30day free trial for every camera you purchased. Example I purchased 4 of these cameras. I hooked 1 up got my 30day free trial then hooked up my 2nd to get its 30day trial. I will have to wait to hook up my other 2 otherwise I loose my free trial for those.I found this out with the other Blink cameras. I had 30days was on like 21days left hooked up Another camera and it reset. I lost those 21days. So to extend the free trial you basically have to hook up each camera one by one to get the full 30days for each camera. On my account with the amount of cameras I've purchased I should get like 3yrs of the \"extra\" features. But I lost them because I hooked up all my cameras together and before the expiration of the trial. \ud83d\ude10 Blink would be 5stars if they put back those features that they are charging for. \ud83d\ude24UPDATE: Fanboys without verified purchases or pictures and videos not understanding what \" difficult \" means throwing shade. Yeah. \ud83d\ude44 Read what I wrote. It explains what I mean by difficult and it does not come with a wedge. I ordered the camera only. 2 of them. I do not see any packages right now that throws in a wedge. You have to buy those separately. The reviews are to review the product. This is not a comment section on YouTube or Facebook. Grow up. Experiences circumstances vary. Understand. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4dThe Good: Camera looks good. Bigger than I thought it would be but it's a good size that draws attention to say hey I'm a doorbell with a camera and I look like a serious thing. Press me I'm going to make a loud noise for you. Picture quality is good so is sound falls inline with the other cameras. Turn on notifications and you get a doorbell with about a second delay. This is cool if I'm in the back in my pool. Works slightly faster than getting a notification that it recorded some motion. \ud83d\udc4dThe Bad: The mount is difficult to mount. Finding a good spot is hard. When you do find a spot they give you a template and drilling screws is not much of a problem. But they didn't think about the various types of doors or any recess like the door frame. My front door is not flush flat with the front of my house. I have a little entrance way. Here's where the nice wider angle becomes useless as I see a lot of brick and a smaller viewing area. \ud83d\ude15 This also affects night vision as the brick whitewashes half the image.Where my existing doorbell is there's ridges. The mount doesn't sit flush. The instructions ask if I'm going to use a wedge. What wedge? There was none included. I placed it at the same height as my doorbell but prefer it to be lower so I get more of the ground than the sky. There's the other difficulty. Finding the right height. Picture yourself in front of it because you can't be behind it or move out of the way to adjust because there is no swivel adjustment.Good thing I didn't drill holes. I used double sided tape. Getting the \"mount\" which is also the back door on the camera is a bit tricky. It is easier once the mount is stable on something to maneuver the camera on but you have to have the mount perfectly flat because it flexes. Probably why people are having a hard time mounting the camera because they did not install the mount perfectly flat for that put on by top then slide down thing.I purchased 2 of these one black one white. I made my own magnetic mount. Sure someone can come along and take it off my door but that one I have on my back door patio. What they need is a door mount. An over the door mount. It would be secure and easily height adjustable and removable. No drilling. They have them for other doorbell cams but none of them currently say they fit this one. It's a simple thing that Blink could make but they left a lot to aftermarket. \ud83d\ude10The Ugly: I initially loved the Blink system as it was battery powered and the batteries last well over a year as I still have yet to replace them. \ud83d\udc4f But then Blink decided to make their customers pay for certain features because no one wanted to sign up for their cloud service. That was a dirty greedy move. I have spent thousands of dollars buying cameras and modules and accessories for my Blink cameras. They also throttle performance and occasionally mess up your system so you have to call them or continually reset your system. They will deny it but why do you think all your footage goes to their servers first. \ud83e\udd14  The system would be faster if it didn't have to. I like the entire Blink cameras and system but I do not like the bait n switch they did. It's funny every time I buy a camera and get a free trial period everything works great then it goes to crap requiring resets and everything once your trial period is over. \ud83e\udd28One of the appealing things when I purchased Blink was that free cloud storage and all the features n options it had. I would have been better off buying a real security system that records all day long with motion alerts n recordings that are not limited to 30 or 60 seconds with a 10 second retrigger time. There's a lot of things Blink cameras miss. A LOT. If you want an expensive baby monitor for the occasionally look see this is it. If you want or need a serious home security system save your money and buy a real system.Stop with the monthly charge subscription greed and I will never link my Amazon account to Blink. You guys are nuts. Go back to giving customers what you set out to give. I love Amazon but the Blink division needs an overhaul. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d", "There\u2019s a few more steps to set up, and requires a blink sync for completely wireless use.

I got the sync module to work fine and it is all hooked up. The door security mount is terrible, it would take someone no time at all to steal it, the set screw that you had on the other model seemed like a better option. But this thing is just out there for the taking, also the 6 retainers that are on this take a bit of time to figure out that you have to push down with enough pressure for them to set and hold. Do you have a recommendation for a better security mount since this one is really bad.", "If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.", "This is a hard camera to mount. It requires you mount the bracket in place very tight before trying to attach. It requires a lot of force then slide down in place. The first one I received was impossible and seem latch was broke. But Blink directly reached out to me and sent another one quickly. It went on and looks good, but like I said requires a lot of downforce.

The doorbell camera does its job. Image quality is great day, and night. At night time the infrared is good allowing you to have good clarity and resolution. You get quick notifications when someone is at your door. You can set it to capture any motion at your property. You can set focus areas, and private areas. You can set the length of record time from 5 to 20 seconds.  The placement of the doorbell we'll also impact what's your camera picks up. But after having had and installing various types of doorbell cameras from Ring and more. I'm satisfied. Why go and buy a $100, or $200 option when you can purchase of $50 option that is just as good.Sure there are some drawbacks, but they will be drawbacks with all of them. If I had to point out any one drawback is that the cameras motion capture has a cool down before it can record again.Example: if the camera has a view of the street and 2 cars go by, the second car could go by without ever being captured on video if it wasn't recorded in the same clip as the first car.You can extend to about of time each clip is allowing you to get more footage. But longer record times use more battery life.I got this one because I already had a hub, and 2 cameras I can capture any, and everything that comes my way. All my Amazon packages are safe, and I know whose at my door Everytime.Bravo, and thank you Blink.", "The mounting bracket is almost impossible to mount. If you do get it on and take it off again good luck putting it back. I went back to my $7 doorbell and camera above the door.", "The Blink video doorbell + sync module 2 might be somewhat OK if you want to continue to utilize the cloud storage option (free 30-day trial is activated by default - probably so you think it works better than it actually will once you cancel the cloud service), but if you're planning to use this setup for local motion-activated recording to a USB stick,  I STRONGLY advise against it. I spent 4 hours last night trying to get the local storage working, and while I would receive motion alerts on my phone, it never once recorded any video. I tried 3 different USB thumb drives, all formatted in exFAT with a PC and with the sync module. Spent over an hour on the phone today with tech support, and while he connected to both the sync module and doorbell repeatedly (and did several reboots) he couldn't figure out the problem either. Then he asked me to download some sketchy app that collects all kinds of info about the health of my home network, and sends it off to who knows where. Yeah, I'm not going to do that. I offered to provide him whatever \"health\" info he needed about my network by using one of the apps I already use to monitor my \"network health\", and he said I had to download that specific app because it's required as the next step in troubleshooting, or he could no longer help me. I also tried troubleshooting using their online support, and encountered endless \"502 Bad Gateway\" errors.Other factors you might want to know:Even if you do finally get the local storage working, according to Blink's website, videos are first transferred to Blink's servers, and then to your USB storage - so you're still dependent on Blink's servers, which is also something that can be taken away or made a \"Premium\" feature in the future.Summary: If you're wanting local storage (a feature that appeals to many of the people interested in this product), this product is FAR from being ready for prime time, and the tech support infrastructure is terrible. AVOID!", "Everything was fine with this except it wouldn\u2019t attach to back cover that attaches to your wall. Kind of a big deal I think. Very poor design to say the least.

The mounting side bracket doesn\u2019t have screws and the process of how a wired connection goes beginning to end is unclear. This product, its design, instructions, and website were not ready for launch. Weighing whether to return or Jimmy it all together. UPDATE: went wireless instead of wired. Found the missing screws once I completely took apart the packaging. Doesn\u2019t feel like Doorbell is quite right after numerous mounting attempts to slide it in as per video on Blink website.", "The media could not be loaded.I've been a Blink customer since the beginning. I have every iteration of their products and was excited to see them offer a doorbell. That excitement wore off quickly after I installed their doorbell and soon turned to disappointment. Here are my issues with the doorbell:1. Short battery life. Even though it's connected to my 24VAC doorbell transformer, it still runs on battery power. I have burned through the first set of lithium AA's in less than 3 weeks of use.2. I had to purchase their angled mount ($8) separately because my doorbell button is low and the doorbell camera was cutting off the heads of tall people.3. Notifications. This is my biggest beef. Right now, if someone rings the bell, you get a  standard notification on your phone. You can also set your Alexa devices to make a voice announcement that the doorbell was rung. That's it. You don't get automatic  live video of the doorbell camera on the app or Echo Shows, Spots etc. You don't know who's there. I suspect this is a hardware limitation of the Blink system. When a Blink camera is recording, you can't pull up a live video feed. I'm doubtful that this critical feature will ever be added.", "The back cover wouldn\u2019t attach to the back right out of the box.", "I have several Blink products and have been very happy with them.  This however has been a terrible experience.  Firstly, it took forever to get this connected to my Blink platform, continual error message and connection fails.Once I finally got this installed I could not get it to connect to my existing chime, despite the fact it met the required specs (16-24V). To me it felt like the metal connectors on the bell were not connecting to the back cover metal connectors.After clipping the unit on and off the back cover several times (attempting to make chime connection) one of the plastic connectors bent making reconnection between the bell and the back cover almost impossible.Finally the tiny flimsy metal connector in the bell snapped rendering the whole thing useless.", "***update 11/13/21**Blink customer service contacted me via email and offered to send me a replacement unit due to the issue that I had below with the mount.  This one appeared to not work at first but I tried anyway and with more effort than felt normal to press down after the mount was screwed in, the replacement unit clicked into place!  For those having issues, I might suggest trying to press IN and DOWN quite hard.  It is not a great design since it doesn\u2019t feel intuitive but it works and I would imagine that a thief would have a difficult time removing it.Original review:Wasn\u2019t able to try out the features due to the mounting back plate refusing to click into place.  After trying for a very long time I checked out the reviews and found that many others are having the same problem.  Wait for an improved design before you buy.", "This is the most ridiculous doorbell I have ever used.  THERE IS NO CHIME BOX INSIDE YOUR HOUSE, so the doorbell will not ring inside your house, so you will never know if someone is at your door, unless you are holding your phone and staring at the screen to see your \"app notification\".  How could they design a doorbell that does not have a way to attach a chime box inside your house so you can hear it ringing?  Sure is silly to go through the blink app at the end of the day to see how many people sat on your porch ringing your new high tech doorbell that does not chime in your house.  Not my normal experience with this innovative company.", "Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration0:06Loaded:27.88%0:00Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:061xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Received this item yesterday. Was able to install the doorbell today. Fairly easy installation. Camera quality is good. I chose this doorbell because of the ability to wire it to my existing chime box in the house. My house was built in the early 80s & the original chime box is compatible & does ring when the doorbell is activated.Got the sync module 2 combo because I had the original sync module for my outdoor cams & wanted to upgrade to local storage. Ordered a Sandisk 256 gb usb drive & works wonderfully with the local storage.If this doorbell cam is anything like the outdoor cameras, I expect the night vision to be good. I tested the microphone & sound quality is as good as I expected.If you\u2019re in the market for a camera doorbell, I do recommend this one. I\u2019m late to the doorbell cam game & feel this was a good purchase.", "I returned my initial camera for a couple of reasons.  I was issued a refund.  However, after several days (and maybe because of my background and I own multiple Blink cameras and my review - I was contacted by Blink and given another Blink Doorbell camera to test and evaluate.  Here is my first tip at eliminating some of the frustration of mounting the camera.Before you start drilling holes in your home to mount the camera - or ready to return the camera because you can\u2019t get it to snap into the back-plate while in your hand or remove it once it is mounted.  Do yourself a favor and test-mount the back-plate on a scrap piece of  2\" x 4\", plywood, etc  (any piece of scrap wood will work as long as IT IS FLAT).  Doing this will let you test and see the ease at mounting and dis-mounting of this camera using the supplied tool.  Hey, if you can't get it to mount on a flat board that you can flip around here and there  - why in the heck would you want to drill holes in your home's door frame or brick and not be able to mount it?  That's only going to make you more aggravated - which is what I did with my first camera that I returned.I did the TEST-MOUNT myself.  And, in doing so - I think I have found what I call \"the niche\" for mounting and dismounting the camera.  Once it seems flush with the back-plate - push the camera upward until you hear a tiny \"click\".  That is the clip at the bottom locking in.  Use the supplied tool to unlock and repeat this again until you feel comfortable with mounting this on your door frame.NOTE - In my opinion, Blink offers one of the best customer support sites I have encountered.  If you have an issue - call them.  Over the past 2 years,  I have had to call them from time to time.  They have helped me with warranty issues and answered my questions to resolve my problems.", "Seems like I am most people here that was confused on how to get the back panel of the doorbell camera to fit. You have to push down and slide the back panel up to lock it. I think of myself to not normally need directions/instructions however this should\u2019ve been included. Also because it\u2019s a newer product not many people are aware. (No YouTube videos or How-To\u2019s online just yet. Hope this helps! Otherwise 4 stars.", "If you have siding stay away from this doorbell.  The backplate is flimsy.  Even with a mounting block, the doorbell doesn't \"click\" into place.  I had to shim the back until it worked.  Horrible mounting process.  They need to release a fix for this backplate and send a new one to anyone who purchased this product.Update 11/21/2021:  Update from 1 to 4 stars.  Blink support reached out and sent me a mounting wedge at no cost.  The wedge is rigid, gives you a nice flat surface, and makes the mounting process much easier.  As far as how the doorbell itself works, it's doing a good job just like the other Blink cameras I have.", "I\u2019ve supported Blink since it was Kickstarter. Big fan, own 10 cameras. Was excited about a doorbell. Hate it. Mounting it on a stucco wall was pure misery due to the flimsy back plate and the worlds most stupid mounting design. Plate flexes so bad that aligning it to mount is next to impossible if mounted to an uneven surface. Tolerance is way too tight to get the plate back on when flexed even a little bit. And good luck finding that tool to open it back up when the batteries die. Needed tech support to get it recognized in Alexa, but to Amazons credit, they were quick, responsive and did a great job. Named it doorbell when I added it to my network, but now the announcement is \u201cThere\u2019s someone at your doorbell\u201d.  I\u2019ve changed every name and setting I can find to front door. Still announces it as doorbell.I blame myself, should have waited for the 2nd generation. But in my defense, Blink has done such a good job on previous releases, and I consider them to be a mature manufacturer now, it never occurred to me they would release such a POS product. Skip this one and get the next generation, hopefully they learn quickly from their mistakes.", "When assembling the doorbell I was not able to get the doorbell housing to attach to the mounting bracket. I could not find a YouTube video that might help. When I went to Blink site I saw several other complaints about the same issue.  The latching mechanism is a flimsy plastic pressure plate that broke in two when I attempted to attach it. I think a redesign is needed so the doorbell  can be securely attached to mounting plate.  I returned and asked for refund as I did not want to revisit the same problem.", "Installation was extremely simple. Setting it up in the app even simpler. Video quality is pretty good in my opinion. It\u2019s a great doorbell. Connected with to Alexa with ease. No chime needed.", "The backplate is poorly designed and will not latch to the doorbell. I called customer support, they kept saying, \u201cSo the backplate is not compatible?\u201d and then put me on hold and shortly thereafter hung up. I have been unable to use this for its intended function since I cannot affix the actual doorbell to the door. I\u2019m going to try to call customer service again and ask for a replacement backplate (even though it is still a garbage design) and if I don\u2019t get one, I\u2019m returning it.", "First my batteries are dead after one week and although my door bell is wired I am told the wires will not power my Blink... with no better explanation. The mounting screws are wrong, they have rounded heads which interfere with locking the doorbell on its mount. Flat headed screws would fix most of those problems. The base is so flimsy that you must mount on an absolutely flat surface or the doorbell with not lock on the base. There is no explanation of the dimensions needed by the base plate, I cut away too much moulding for lack of info. There should be a \"wedge to angle the camera out from its corner in an installation like mine, there is only a wedge to look up not \"over there\". There should be a link or something to a primer on door bell types so people can trouble shoot things like \"The wired installation will not power your door bell because...\". All in all it seems like a Chinese product that would have been better if the developers were Americans who were familiar with American housing and doorbells. This product reminds me of an old Product Manager's mantra \"Be Happy, Ship Crappy\"; true this was so a product would ever ship at all because engineers are never ready to ship. Bottom line is it does not uphold the standards that Amazon sets for its products  and it should.Update:My original search for the \"corner wedge\" only found the \"down wedge\" however the corner wedge exists! I found it at the Blink Store section and it arrived today and looks great. It fixes a lot of issues.The afore mentioned dead batteries were a missdiagnosis. The door bell went off line the first day for a while but came back when I rang it. When it went off line again it would not ring (sense me thinking it was batteries) but instead I followed the WiFi reset procedure and it came back to life; it had to be re-added to the Sync 2 as a new door bell. Fortunately I renamed it the same so Alexa's Skill would not get confused. So there seems to be a WiFi issue. FWIW I run a top of the line Netgear router.Now on to another issue... Wired but no power!! The instructions say nothing about the possibility that your existing door bell may have a diode at its button. If a digital chime is added to an old mechanical set up as a replacement door bell there needs to be a diode in line to complete the full digital chime. Blink ignores this and and when you \"set-up\" the Blink door bell it makes you think a digital door chime cannot provide \"Wired Power\" so you have to run the Blink door bell on battery power. If you find the little diode (looks like a small resistor) under you old button you should install it one the new backing plate and tell the Blink Door bell Set-Up\" that your door bell is Mechanical. Eh Viola suddenly your installation does provide \"Wired Power\"; what a huge difference wired power makes as you finish your set-up.SO let's see if my door bell stays on line now. Also the Blink support team has contacted me directly to offer help... that is impressive.", "**** Updated!  After Blink saw my initial review, they reached out to me and sent a replacement.  I was able to install this one and it seems to be working as intended.  There is some lag time, but that's to be expected as all of the Blink cameras do the same.  I'm still trying to figure out how to make it work with my Echo Show.  It says it's connected, but it doesn't show on the Echo Show when someone rings the Doorbell. Maybe that feature isn't available yet?  I would really like it to be so that my girls can view it when they are home without having to have the app on their phone.  I'll be curious to see how long the battery lasts, but that will take some time before I can say anything about that.  I wish I could have wired it, but my house is a much older house and didn't have wiring available.  I will say I was extremely impressed with Blink's customer service and Haitham who reached out to me to make sure everything was working as intended with the new device.Original review:  Super disappointed. I was extremely excited to get this and try it out, and I got it all synced with my system and tried it out and it worked great! Unfortunately, the back piece that is supposed to be mounted to the wall that the doorbell snaps into didn\u2019t work. Myself and my husband tried for quite some time to get it to snap together, and it wasn\u2019t happening no matter how hard we pushed. It\u2019s clearly a design flaw. Having to return.", "Angle or corner mount recommended. Batteries required even for wired installation. Love wide angle view of doorbell camera. Only wired chimes supported.", "The image only shows a wide angle view instead of a tall view so you can only see the upper half of the person. There is no way to see if there is a package at your doorstep . Tried using the wedge that is available but it made very little difference.  This is the wrong aspect ratio for a video doorbell, but works ok as a regular camera.", "Out of the box set up only took maybe 10 minutes. The blink app walks you through the whole setup and I found this incredibly helpful. Take you\u2019re time and don\u2019t rush the setup out of excitement. I can see what others are saying about struggling to get the doorbell attached to the plate but really it was not very difficult. Just apply a bit of pressure and push down. The doorbell should go right into place. We are blink users so we already owned the sync mod 2 and external drive for extra storage so we knew we didn\u2019t have to buy one BUT YES you need to have the sync mod 2 for the doorbell. Over all this was an easy walked through set up and we are happy thus far.Gave a 4/5 stars because it\u2019s only day 1. Will update in a month", "I have requested a replacement, which will take around 3 weeks to ship.Terribly disappointed with the make, as the back cover was already off when I opened the box and turned out that it was broken.Chatted with customers support who took a while to understand what I was saying, and eventually recommended me to order a replacement and return the current order.Hope the new one isn't in the same condition, else will switch to Ring I suppose.", "UPDATE: I\u2019ve had more use time with my Blink Doorbell Cam and I\u2019ve now updated my previous review from a 3 to a 5.  As you\u2019ll be able to read from my initial comments below, I had some issues with the Blink Doorbell generating chime audio sounds to my iPhone when the doorbell was rung.  However, the problem was not due to the Blink Doorbell but rather, the issue stemmed from the design of my Apple Watch.  Blink tech support proactively contacted me in regards to this issue, and have worked with me to understand the issue further.  In the meantime, Apple has provided a workaround in which I control from the Apple Watch App Notification settings, which iPhone apps I wish to have notifications sent to the watch.  By unchecking the Blink app notification setting, I now am able to hear the doorbell chime notifications from my iPhone.In addition, I\u2019ve since become aware that I would be able to have the doorbell chime from Alexa capable devices.  So after testing the doorbell integration with a Echo Show, and an Echo Dot, the doorbell chime audio is no longer an issue now, because the doorbell chime echoes in several rooms along with my phone.And in the case of the Echo Show, I\u2019m actually able to see video of who is at the door when someone depresses the doorbell or if I\u2019m simply interested in what that strange noise was out front.Prior to switching over to the Blink Doorbell Cam, I had been using a first generation Ring Doorbell, and the performance on the Blink is a lot better.As a result of these events and associated results, I am now able to give the Blink Doorbell 5 stars and I can definitely recommend it to others.So I\u2019m a longtime supporter of a Blink Cameras and they work so well, I thought I\u2019d try their doorbell when it became available.  It\u2019s a well made product physically, made of good quality materials.  You need not worry about that aspect.  It in terms of design, I have mixed emotions after setting it up on my door and using it.The first thing I noticed at night was that the night vision is almost useless for my particular home.  This is because like many homes, my front door is recessed into the front of the house a bit forming sort of an indented area.  As such, that\u2019s where my front door light is located and it illuminates my front door area real well, with light bouncing off the walls.  With all that light surrounding the camera, seeing through it for nice vision is impossible.  What you wind up seeing is just a blackened area beyond the lighted door area.  I\u2019m sure Blink engineers designed a great night vision camera for use in perfect conditions, but turning my front porch light off at night to allow it to work properly is just not an option.  So point number one.  If your door sits in a well lit area, consider whether night vision will work for any doorbell cam should you buy one.Second point.  I didn\u2019t realize this when I bought the camera, but to date, Blink offers no way to connect the camera to a external chime accessory.  I knew this going in, but my results where mixed on the usability of a doorbell cam only chime audio, plus the ability to chime through my iPhone app.  I thought that would be ok.  After all, I have my phone with me all the time.  But the chime would not sound on either my iPhone or my wife\u2019s.  We worked with Apple to understand why and we found out that if a user owns an Apple Watch, by default, when the watch is being worn (and is unlocked via it\u2019s PIN), the iPhone will not play the Blink doorbell sound because the notification goes to the watch instead.  And when the watch sounds the Blink notification, it does not have the ability to play the doorbell chime sound.  The only notification you\u2019ll receive is the standard \u201cping\u201d sound that all notifications (regardless of app) plays for Apple Watch notifications.  So in effect, if you own an iPhone AND you\u2019re an Apple Watch user, recognize that you won\u2019t be able to hear the distinct doorbell chime audio on your phone when wearing your watch.  As far as the sound that does play from the door, it\u2019s loud enough to hear indoors most of the time, but if you\u2019re out in the backyard, you probably won\u2019t hear it.  NOTE: I don\u2019t want to write more of a novel than I already have here, but if you\u2019re interested in understanding how to send the doorbell (and any other notification to your phone even while wearing your Apple Watch, contact support and ask them how to turn off notifications for specific apps in the Apple Watch app, to prevent them from going to the watch and forcing them to play on the iPhone).This brings up my 3rd point.  As far as i\u2019m able to tell, the Blink Doorbell is only able to play the 1 audio chime that comes with it, if you opt NOT to hardwire your Blink Doorbell to an existing doorbell chime wiring.  We no longer have doorbell wiring, so I was happy to use the Blink Doorbell\u2019s chime, but I was hoping there was an option to play a variety of chimes from the doorbell.  Sadly, this does not appear to be the case.  It\u2019s not a showstopper for me, but that would have been a nice feature to have.As far as the app is concerned, if you\u2019re a Blink user, you know that the Blink app is pretty good as far as features.  The one feature we like is the ability to \u201ctune\u201d where the camera has visibility to, to tone down false alerts from cars passing by.  For battery life on the Blink Doorbell, I can\u2019t say yet if the battery life is anything like the Blink cameras, but I\u2019m extremely happy with the battery life on the cameras.  I believe Blink touts up to a year.  I think I have some cameras that have not required a battery change for 8 months now, but this is dependent on motion sensitivity settings, camera video recording duration, etc.  So your mileage may vary.", "Bought this over a Ring because I have no desire too have multiple apps for the cameras in my house.  Figured it'd be a \"great value\" Ring, since Amazon owns Ring also but Im pleasantly surprise by the quality. FYI, the wedge for an extra 25\u00b0 of angle or tilt is already included in the box. I bought with the sync module 2.I have many Blink minis and Blink cams in and out of my house. The picture quality of this is on par with any other Blink cam and it gives a door notification when someone rings it. I have mine hard wired using the existing wires for my door bell. When I ring the the Blink it also rings by door bell ringer inside my house just like I wanted. To my knowledge the Ring Brand cams dont do this unless you buy a separate speaker. No extra speaker needed here. I cannot speak if you just use the battery only operation. I doubt their be any way to use you're existing door chime unless you hardwire this. Hard wiring is easy, their is no polarity since it senses it automatically.As far as the final mounting to the base on my wall, it is tricky. I see a few reviews on here just about how hard it is to clip onto the wall or saying its defective. You definitely need a bit a finesse to get it to pop/lock in to the base plate on the wall but its snug. Also it has a security key like things you have to use to remove so someone can walk up and easily snatch it off your wall.Overall its an excellent product for the price.", "I was disappointed.  Description did not say you had to purchase an additional sync module to use live video.  This feature is always included with every other video doorbell.  This is misleading because the product is called a \"Video Doorbell\" but video is not included.Also, the packaging was so tight that it could not be opened without damaging the packaging.I have returned it.", "I was excited to purchase this product because of the reviews and the quality.  Disappointed that I could not mount the backing plate to the wall without causing a bulge in the middle due to the wires coming out of the wall.  Because of the bulge, I could not mount the main unit onto the backing plate.  As expected, a tab broke off when trying to apply a ginger amount of pressure.  If it did go, it was only a matter of time before the main unit would pop off and prevent from doing its job.  Very poor engineering by not allowing enough room for the doorbell wires.  Something tells me there wasn't any or not enough product testing before sending to market.  Typical nowadays.  Unless you have a spacer between the back plate and the wall, I would not recommend this product.  I guess for the price, you get what you pay for.Update: 11/10/21I increased the stars to 3 because someone from Blink @ Amazon took the time to reach out to me, provide technical support and a new product to try again.  They\u2019re taking this serious and that is hard to find these days.  I haven\u2019t installed it yet but it does look favorable so far.  I will update again once the install is complete.  Thanks for the effort.  That alone is worth it to me.Update: 11/13/21Installed the doorbell today with the wedge.  Install went like it should.  Every doorbell should come with the wedge when purchased.  It provides the necessary space for the wires coming out of the wall.  Now, I will use it for the next month or so and provide another update.  Looking at getting cameras connected here soon to see how it all integrates. Again, thanks for the great support (Blink) on this issue.", "I'm extremely disappointed in the poor built and quality control for the Blink Doorbell. The cover or backplate of the doorbell does not even fit and close properly. It keeps popping out. Blink customer service also was not available to help. The normal Amazon customer service representative simply sent a replacement. Hopefully the same issue does not happen again.Updated on 11/26/2021: Blink customer service was able to rectify my problem by sending me a replacement unit. The new unit works well, but still takes some effort to close the cover if you are not planning to mount it against a wall. The customer service representative who resolved my issue was very attentive and took notes on my feedback. I hope and encourage Blink to design future doorbells in order to provide a better customer experience. In general, the software, the camera, and the sync module work very well. There is some latency, but it does the job. The video quality in general and at night is decent, but don't expect to see minute details very well. The microphone does catch wind noise and there is a constant white noise sound. I appreciate how the cloud can save up to 60 days of video and the USB storage is convenient. The data files are not too large, so a 64 gb can last a long time. I've used the doorbell camera for a little less than a month and only 3% of data was used in my USB drive.", "Finally my Blink cam system is complete. It took a long time for them to complete the doorbell but it seems like time was well-spent. The slim doorbell camera provides an exceptionally wide view of the whole area in front of the house.  Night vision is very good and as usual with Blink products everything is in the package.  So far my cameras theat I\u2019ve already installed are doing well with the 2 lithium batteries AA in each and I\u2019m amazed at the life. My prior doorbell camera was powered by slightly larger AA type batteries (2) and required weekly replacement which although they were rechargeable was a total pain in the butt. I stopped using it and when I saw Blink doorbell was about to come out , I preordered one and got it sooner than predicted. My outdoor cameras which use the same AA lithium batteries have been running for at least 2 months on the same batteries.  The guides say the batteries should last approximately 2 years , which remains to be seen , but they still show power level is ok and if necessary to replace any that have more activity sooner it is not difficult nor expensive to replace. I bought a 48 pack of Bevigor brand AA lithium batteries on Amazon for about $1. per battery and they are advertised as being better than the Energizer batteries as far as their leakproof design and I will review them once I start using them. I was impressed with the ease of adding cameras and doorbell to the smartphone app and the cameras have many reasonably priced accessories for mounting in different places and ways. As far as my research has shown: Blink cameras seem to be well designed and live up to their claims. Most people who\u2019ve had them longer than I have are stating that the battery life is holding up and the new design uses either cloud storage at a monthly charge and/or a sync2 system that accepts up to a 256 GB thumb drive for local storage which makes the cloud storage unnecessary and saves us from paying monthly charges. There are many different packages or each item can be purchased separately. The usb storage device is less than $30. if bought separately plus the cost of whatever thumb drive you use with it. So far I have all 5 star ratings for the system and the accessories purchased for mounting were inexpensive and provided clips for hooking cameras to vinyl siding, clips for hooking tightly to sheds/trees/windows or anyplace with a spot to clip it, they also have accessories to provide 25-30 feet of electrical cord which can be used instead of batteries and they also make electrical powered Blink mini-cams which are good for small offices or rooms. I\u2019ve even seen solar powered outdoor lights with a spot to add a camera to and I expect new items to be coming out as thought of. System is relatively inexpensive and can be started small and added too as finances allow if you cannot spend the $400. or so for a well equipped system. The cameras hold up well to weather in the northeast and are hearty little devices. As you see , I cannot say enough about the Blink system and I\u2019ll add one more item. Amazon has bought the company and has everything available on their site. Don\u2019t get fooled by \u201cBlink Factory Store\u201d which I ordered through 2 times and never received products which PayPal immediately refunded to my acct. Best deal is Amazon or most stores that carry it will probably match their prices.", "Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration-:-Loaded:0%Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:001xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.The camera works great but the design is defective and I have to use tape to mount it.

Blink has by far the best customer service. Very responsive and easy to contact.2. Excellent price3. Integration with other Blink camera products4. Alexa integration5. Flexible settings to fit most needs and installations.6. Ability to use existing doorbell wiring.7. First doorbell defective. Did not detect motion.Cons.1. Mounting bracket is a nightmare to work with. Very difficult to secure camera to included mounting bracket. Plastic is to thin and flexes preventing proper attachment. How the unit slid over the mount to attach is NOT intuitive. Tip: Watch the installation video. If you need longer screws make sure screw head does not stick out as this will also prevent camera from attaching to mount. Use only the holes pre drilled on the bracket. This issue is known to Blink and I believe they are trying to come up with an updated mount to address all of these issues.2. Some setup instructions are not clear.3. I was not getting any motion detection from the camera. Customer service determined the unit was defective and sent a replacement. No issues with replacement.Tips:1. To access all features use with sync module which is not included. If you already have Blink cameras it will connect to your existing sync module. A battery only setup with no sync does not allow you to view the video feed unless someone rings the bell.2. If you are attaching to a home with Vinyl/Aluminum siding the camera may not sit flush. Consider purchasing a Blink doorbell wedge mount. You can also purchase a corner mount which tilts the camera in. I ended up buying the wedge mount and a Vinyl siding surface mounting block.3. I did not initially think my camera was getting power from the home wires as when I did attach it without batteries in it did not power on. You initially set it up with the batteries and need to scan the QR code on the back of the camera. I thought my home transformer may be an issue even though it meet the requirements listed. After you do the initial setup and install the camera go back and do the setup again where it will ask you about the wiring. There are additional setting in the camera menu concerning the home wiring option.

And if it does good luck on not breaking the tab the first time you have to change the batteries.  I purchased 2 of these and will be returning both.  I will be fair though and only leave 1 bad review but this deserves 2.  I did not get the right screws to secure the angled bracket and wasted a drive to the hardware store to get my own. Only to find that the back would not secure and when a little extra pressure was applied the tab broke. I think that piece was made of crackers\u2026I was really excited when this was announced,, so I could add it to my existing blink system and I never ever pre-order anything this is my first time and last time doing that.  Wait until they announce a redesign before you buy this or hit yourself in the head with a hammer your choice\u2026", "The quality and functionality of the blink camera system and app is hard to beat. We previously purchased blink XT2 cameras and have been very happy with them. I was excited to check out the new blink doorbell camera recently and I\u2019ve absolutely loved it. Similarly to the other camera options it\u2019s a seamless setup and easy to follow installation. The video quality is excellent and the doorbell works great. Very happy with the end product and I would highly recommend blink to anyone for home security from anything outdoor to indoor cameras to now this blink door bell. It integrates well with Alexa, the interface of the app is very user friendly, the quality of the video and the ability to adjust the settings is unlike anything else on the market.", "Replaced my original Ring doorbell with this. Installation was easy. I did not have a problem attaching it to the base that others had, but the base is very flimsy. The Ring build was much better but also cost 4x as much. I had to make sure that the Blink base was completely flat as it\u2019s tendency was to bend against the stucco. I also had to push the tab at the bottom from the back to get it to snap together. It did not require a lot of pressure, just perfect alignment. Picture quality is good and app works as expected. Not sure how it will work when the subscription trial ends as the website is confusing in regards to how it works with the sync 2 module. I got this rather than a new Ring so I would have local storage rather than using a cloud subscription plan. Note: if you are replacing a Ring doorbell, the footprint on the Blink is narrower and you will need to fill the previous mounting holes.", "I\u2019ve owned Blink cameras for over two years now, and for the most part they\u2019ve worked very well, and have excellent battery life. The video doorbell is a welcome addition. Setup and configuration was straightforward; physical installation took about 5 minutes; no issues or problems. Integrates nicely with Alexa, with a variety of standard chimes and sounds, plus a bunch of seasonal sound choices as well. I\u2019m a renter and couldn\u2019t mess with the existing doorbell, so i covered it with a Knock Nanny (which I bought on Amazon). Installed the Blink doorbell on the door fame right next to it, 4-1/2 feet from the porch floor. Even if someone is standing only 2 feet from the door their face can easily be seen in the video. Within the app, I moved Motion Detection Sensitivity down to 4, which triggers the camera at the ideal time when someone is approaching. I\u2019ve had a couple false triggers from passing trucks, so I may lower Sensitivity another notch, or possibly set some Activity Zones if it becomes an issue. My only complaint is the loudness of the doorbell sound at the unit itself. It\u2019s nice that pressing the button generates a sound, because that confirms to the person pressing it that the doorbell is actually working; but half the volume or less would suffice. Overall though, I am very pleased with the Blink Video Doorbell.Update - 11/15/2021: Configured an Activity Zone (actually an inactivity zone) within the app to block out an area of the road from motion detection. (The road is about 40 feet from the doorbell).  Ever since I made the change, I haven\u2019t had a false trigger (over a week now).", "The installation is \"difficult\" but that's only due to the 6 flimsy tabs on the backplate that hook into the doorbell.  Mine came with 2 tabs broken but I got it to hook on anyway.  The camera on the doorbell is the same quality as any of the cameras and has an impressive field of vision, gotta be like 175 degrees or so.  The chime is fairly loud on the doorbell itself which doesn't make sense, the person already knows they pushed it.  However it was barely audible inside a quiet house so the wireless option is a big zero in my eyes.  I don't have a wired doorbell so couldn't test hooking it up.  So my phone (with the Blink app) would ping a notification that the doorbell camera sees someone there, but that's the same as any of the Blink cams.Three things they could do better is 1) give the app a chime just for the doorbell that works when the doorbell button is pushed.  2) make the backplate stronger with an easier installation (connecting doorbell to backplate).  3) the Chime on the doorbell itself could be toned down a lot, you can hear it across the street.  And finally 4) have a wireless chime for inside the house to make the wireless installation worth anything.I ended up deciding to return mine 15 minutes after installing it.  Without a chime on the phone app, and not being able to hear the chime inside the house, it's just another cam so useless as a doorbell (again, just the wireless option).  I was all excited to see a Blink doorbell because I love their camera and have several around my property, but it's just not for me.Blink should offer a in-home wireless chime that sounds a tone when the doorbell button is pushed.  If they offered that with the doorbell I might have kept it.  If Blink has one, I couldn't find it on Amazon or on their Blink website.I do NOT recommend this doorbell - at least not in it's present state.", "The mount is garbage. it'll take you about 10 attempts to get it to finally click home, but it's counterintuitive and a really poor design. I have a Sync 2 module, so I'm good already and don't have to worry about the saving of my video clips. The video quality is exactly what I expected and it connected right up to my entire Blink Alexa system. I'm also using the wired power system from my pre-existing doorbell - so I'm never going to have to take it back off the mount. I also have a Ring but now that I have this I'm not going to have to pay for the overly expensive Ring subscription when renewal time comes up, so that's a bonus. plus I'm now all in one ecosystem.", "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Ordered Oct 15 and received Nov 9.  Works great with my existing 3 camera system.Mounted it over the original doorbell on house.  Tried to get it to work with the house mechanical chime, but would not work.  It is a rented house so I'm not going to delve into why. Yes, it was hard to mount in, but got it in a few tries.  While installing we had to take it down a few times but were able to get it back in the slots and \"lock\" it in.  Should be fun to do again when the batteries die.Press the button and it chimes at the doorbell.  A second or 2 later I get alerted on my phone, my 2 echo dots and my echo show 5.  Video is good day and night.  In my opinion it is the same quality as my 3 cameras.Having never owned a doorbell camera I don't know if this is normal.....sometimes twice a day the blink app will alert me about a video from my doorbell.  It is a video of stills taken throughout the day anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds long.  Just weird to me, but interesting to see.I am happy with my purchase and would buy again (especially if they fix the mounting issue).", "Update 11/9/21:I purchased the sync module 2, since wiring is not an option and removed and re-added the doorbell and was able to get live view. The customer support that reached out after this review was incredibly helpful. I was not comfortable enabling access to my system, and they helped me anyway. A big thank you to Haitham!Still leaving it with 4 stars because I didn't really want to purchase yet another thing to make it work, but it worked and it looks good. So 4 stars, one less for having to buy additional tech.-----It was easy to install and easy enough to get working, but I am left wanting after having Ring doorbells in the past that allowed me to view a live video. I have read all documentation, searched everywhere online, and all instructions say the same thing, \"Press the Live View button\" and a picture of a little camera in the bottom left corner of the video preview. But, on my device, THERE IS NO BUTTON. There is NO WAY to view a live video stream from this doorbell, very disappointing.", "Bought this product, thinking it would be a great alternative to a Ring doorbell. It was easy to install, does not look very secured. I testing the motion and doorbell both worked after installation, but tested again after 10 min. I was now not getting any notification for motion or doorbell. The Blink just became an analog doorbell. Also found out after that some of the features that is on the app does not yet work. Very disappointed.", "Update: 12/03/2021I ordered another blink doorbell on sale for Black Friday.  I put the door bell on my back door.  I did not want to drill in my brick so I purchased some outdoor industrial Velcro.  My backyard is fenced in, so there is less chances of the doorbell being stolen.  I really wanted the back door doorbell for the camera function.  It is hard to attach the camera to the back plate unless the back plate is mounted.  The way to resolve this issue is put the back plate on the doorbell and push up from the bottom with a flat head screw driver.  Once this is done yo can you Velcro to mount the doorbell.  I would not suggest mounting the doorbell with Velcro if you live in a high crime area or you think the doorbell might be stolen.I was a blink customer before Amazon purchased the company.  I have been waiting for this blink doorbell for over 3 years.  It is finally here and for the most part I am pleased.  The functionality of the camera is excellent.  The only issue I have is the back plate and the hardware for installation.  The back plate that comes with the unit is universal for wired or wireless.  If you are using wireless the doorbell does not sit flush to the wall.  I used some outdoor double sided tape to make it stable and flush.The screws that come with the unit are too long.  I used a shorter screw but the head was too big and it hit the batteries when I tried to install the doorbell.  When I replaced the screws with a smaller head the doorbell installed easily.  Before I figured that out it was a nightmare trying to install the doorbell to the back plate.Here are some needed improvements for the blink/ amazon team:1.  Have 2 back plates.  (1 for wireless and 1 for wired)2.  Have a wireless chime so when the doorbell rings you can hear it through out the houseOther than that this is an excellent product.  I wish Amazon had released it 3 years ago when it was supposed to come out.Update:  11/04/21There is an option to announce on all alexa devices in your house that the door bell has been pressed.  You go to devices in your alexa app an choose cameras.  In cameras locate the door bell.  In the door bell settings turn the announcement feature on.  In my opinion this is just as good as having a wireless chime when some one presses the door bell.  I have also noticed many people having trouble with the back plate.  If you use your own screws make sure the head is small especially on the bottom screw.  If the screw head is large it is impossible to attach the door bell to the back plate.", "make sure you plan/investigate before you purchase this bargain. as technology goes, this integrates well into my blink system. That's where the good things stop.  If you have an older (mid 80's) house that was pre-wired for a doorbell with a recessed conduit box as a mount, you are in for some work and modifications.(see image2) my original doorbell button was mountd on a permanent conduit box where the wires come in from behind.these conduit boxes have industry stndard mounting screw holes for face plates. the design engineers of this unit weren't thoughtful enough to make the pre-drilled mounting holes on the  back plate to correspond with conduit screw holes. this will require modification of the back plate by drilling a small hole so it can mount on the existing conduit box. In addition I had to use the old faceplate to cover the opening of the conduit box, which looks like crap at my front door. (see image 1)  The only other fashionable option would be to  make a wood plate with a hole for wires that would have to be drilled and mounted to conrete (in my case).  After all this work my existing indoor chime does not ring when the button is pushed. it is wired correctly and i tested the circuit by bridging the contacts on the back of the mounting plate with a screw driver and the indoor chime rang. after attaching the camera unit to the back plate the indoor chime does not work. I have made sure the camera unit was snapped flush to contact the contacts on the back plate.  At this point I'm too disgusted and frustrated to dis-assemble the unit and do further testing. Luckily i have multiple Amazon devices throughout my house Show/dot etc. to know when the camera is activated. so if you think this is an easy $50 add-on device you better plan ahead. Obviously I am handy, but it will run up a bill if you have to hire someone to fashion a remedy.", "Update after 1 month of useThe system stay okay when I was in free trial for blink cloud subscription. Even though the response speed is way slower than its competitor. It takes about 5s to open the live view and 5-10s to retrieve a cloud clips.And it's even worse when you go for local storage option. For me, the local module didn't record any motion detected at first. And after number of reconnections, it's then magically start working.And it's far slower to retrieve a clip from local storage than retrieve it from the cloud. (as Blinks Q&A, it depends on your local wifi condition, mine is 200mbps downstream/10mbps upstream, but still, it takes me over 30s to load a 15s clips)And another issue is with the battery drainage.Even if I power up the doorbell through the chime wire, the battery still drain fast when you turn up the detection sensitivity. I set it to 7/10, and after replacing two brand new Duracell, it prompts a 20% low battery warning the next day.And when the battery is low, it will comes up more problem. For example, longer response time for Echo/Alexa alerts(sometimes not response at all), system busy alerts will show up more frequently. The cold outdoor temperature might be a reason(around 36 F at night), but draining 80% of battery in a day is not acceptable especially when it's already powered through the chime wire.", "We have many blink cameras outside and inside our home so I was excited to see a door bell and pre ordered it immediately. It was a huge disappointment. The back to it is nearly impossible to attach, which i\u2019ve read in the reviews is very common. They also sent a promo for a free corner mount, which came with screws that go from the camera to the mount that are too small to screw in. This whole thing was a major fail. Amazon definitely needed to take more time with this.", "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Update: Blink support contacted me shortly after leaving this review about the frames skipping. They think it's the batteries and are sending me new ones free. They said they will replace the camera if the batteries do not fix the issue. They also said this camera does in fact use a PIR sensor like the wireless blink outdoor camera for motion detection which is good news. It means bugs won't be attracted to it or trigger a needless recording event.Sometimes the recordings skip frames at the beginning of the motion event. Live view also doesn't work 50/50 percent of the time. It says \"live view failed.\" The saved settings for IR also mess up a lot across all of my blink devices, not just the doorbell.Regardless, I bought a second one for the back door since the Black Friday deal started and they're dirt cheap. I'm hoping a firmware update can fix these issues at some point.Something tells me the infrared stays on 24/7 for motion detection at night which means bugs will be attracted to it and set it off continuously. The blink mini I have outside does the same thing and I have to turn off notifications for it because it's so obnoxious. The outdoor wireless version doesn't have this issue because it uses a PIR sensor instead for motion detection to save battery life. I don't think the doorbell has that. I imagine it will chew through batteries constantly if you aren't able to hard wire it to your existing doorbell to power it that way instead.", "Does anyone at Blink actually install this stuff? Like I get the firm impression that no one at Blink / Amazon has ever held a drill in their tender, soft hands.The doorbell and camera system work as expected. Inexpensive and mostly just work. Just like most Blink products.But like every Blink product since before they were bought by Amazon the mounting and install system is terrible. I installed the back plate as demonstrated (wireless mode) and the doorbell wouldn\u2019t attach to the mounting plate. Spent 15 minutes trying to attach it to the plate with zero luck.Took the plate off and started screwing with it. Noticed that the soft plastic was essentially bent a bit (e.g. warped) and that the doorbell couldn\u2019t clip in unless the plate was very flush.Took the plate and a power driver and smashed that f\u2019er flat to the door trim. I probably stripped out the screws doing this (that\u2019s another persistent issue with Blink\u2019s engineering \u2014 they always include the softest, cheapest screws) but managed to clip the doorbell in this time. How I am getting it off if / when I move? No clue.From a tech perspective, works great. But Blink needs to hire some actual craftsman to work on their mounting system. It\u2019s a a persistent issue across the product line but this doorbell is the worst. I swear no one at Blink has ever touched a hammer", "Seems to work as expected for those that need a battery powered doorbell (also able to be wired in). The storage feature being USB is neat although there is not an included mount. It is a box with a usb charger that will otherwise dangle off your outlet unless you have somewhere to set it. I managed to double sided tape the box to the charger so that it is \"mounted\" to the outlet. Works well enough.As for multi-users, this does not seem possible in the sense of multiple accounts. My solution was to use the one account created to login on all devices that wanted access to the camera. This seems like a silly missing feature, but forgettable in the scheme of things.The doorbell itself seems to be of decent build quality and has a nice aesthetic to it. Nothing super fancy, but definitely functional for the price.Image quality is decent. Not the best I've seen, but absolutely not the worst. Same with sound quality.The software has a few short comings. Past the multi-users issue I mentioned, the lack of quick responses like most other smart doorbells have is disappointing. Or the ability to set auto responses upon detection.  It does sync well with Alexa and my dots make the noise expected when the button is pressed. It just seems under baked for such a prominent companies offering.A good buy so far, but solely for the price. Features may be lacking for some.", "I rated this one star because the mount is TERRIBLE!!!!  It is very difficult to put on and take off.  It is NOT like other mounts with the safety screw at the bottom. I was only able to get the doorbell on the mount once but couldn\u2019t get it off.  It feels like you are going to break it when you take it off.  The doorbell can be easily stolen because of the mount.", "I like the doorbell bell camera. I tried to get the back to doorbell to snap on to the back mount but it wouldn\u2019t. My other concern was finding out if the doorbell could be connected to my wifi extension. I called tech support and agent was very helpful in telling be how to return my doorbell for a refund. I really got no answer about why the doorbell wouldn\u2019t attach to the base or if the unit can be connected through a Wi-Fi extender. I would like to purchase the unit again if I could get on that would attach as it should and also could be connected to my Wi-Fi extender. I use the Blink system and have been pleased I have at least two cameras connected to my Wi-Fi extender. I have several hours invested in this doorbell and nothing to show for it except for what I have learned which isn\u2019t much.Update: I added one star for the excellent follow up help I received. I am now pleased with the Doorbell, I just have a lot of time invested in getting it properly installed and connected. The doorbell alerts me through Alexa devices and Apple phone and iPad. Mounting worked well once I attached the base plate with screws. I moved my sync device closer to camera so I didn\u2019t have to use Wi-Fi extender, although that is an option. Being able to get a view on Echo Show when the doorbell is pressed without having to ask for it would be nice.", "11/19/21I'm not a reviewer, I paid for this product to add it to my current Blink system. The video quality is pretty solid, especially for the money, in my opinion. There are cameras/doorbells considerably more expensive with similar features and video quality. I think Blink could have sold this doorbell for $99 without too much trouble.As others have stated, the mount is very questionable. I don't know how it could have been released without people thinking \"this mount is a problem\". Connecting the camera to it is very much 50/50 between hoping it is secured on and that you aren't about to break the mount or the camera. I think Blink will find a way to remedy this issue.I did the hardwired installation and ran in to an issue with it not ringing my doorbell chime in the house. Called Blink support and got someone on the phone immediately. They accessed my Blink app and maybe did an update/setting change because I reinstalled the doorbell on the app and everything worked great.Blink, fix the mount issue (and work out something to remedy the issues for those that already bought them) and you'll have a solid product I think.", "I'm having mixed feelings about the Blink Video Doorbell. This is my second video doorbell, and the Blink is considerably different from the first one (another brand). First, the box is a beautiful thing to behold, but somewhat challenging to 'unlock' without destroying it. Second, I expected written instructions. All of the instructions were delivered by the app. Of course, I did things in the wrong order, and had to undo and redo. The video quality is remarkable, even on a phone screen. The camera shows quite a panorama, which is excellent for the location I chose. The notifications tell me exactly when something moves in the range of view (and I can block some areas).  I do get a notification every time there is movement, which can be annoying.  I thought I could correct the problem by making longer recordings, but there doesn't seem to be any reference to that in the app.The doorbell is a recent acquisition, and should Blink reach out and answer my questions, I will be happy to update this review.Update: And indeed, Blink did reach out to me, and offered a solution that should resolve any issues that I might have had. Great customer service!", "i am a blink camera user with 9 of them throughout my house. also use the sync module. i also have 2 echos in the house.purchased the bell because i dont have a wired bell and currently use a simple wireless bell with plug in chimes.  i was very excited about this product but was let down by lack of thought when it comes to the chime. the chime works with the echos however you have to make sure your echo is on super loud because it only rings for about 2 seconds and if you dont have a device in every room you wont hear it. the phone alerts are good and work same as the cameras, but with a doorbell it needs to be heard. if i dont have my phone in front of me ill miss the door. i was disappointed that blink could not come up with a companion chime similar to how ring has a plug in chime. going to return and explore other options for video doorbells.", "Bought this as I am an avid Amazon shopper and trust Amazon to put out a comparable item to other name brands.  I followed ALL the instructions to the T.  The power supply (no doorbell) was a transformer that matched every detail in the instructions.  Still did not get the full use of the Blink doorbell!  Used the text to ask for support.  All I got was the same info.  I bought an entirely newer transformer.  Connected it to the Blink.  No change, still gave me the message my power supply was too weak!!  Enough is enough!  I ordered a Ring doorbell the cheapest Amazon carried, connected the transformer, mounted the Ring and within honestly 10 minutes, I had video, live view, motion and chimes adjusted!  I will not buy another Blink.  Sad that Amazon would allow this defective doorbell to carry the Amazon name.  Now, if you have a powerful mechanical doorbell hookup, this may work for you but if you do not have an installed home doorbell that is mechanical you are SOL.  Sending mine back for a refund!", "I pre ordered 2 Blink doorbells and received them over the weekend. 10/25/21Had issues and vented on my first review on the doorbells. I have since deleted that part of the review. If you\u2019re having issues with your Blink products do not try to contact Amazon and try to get it resolved, go directly to Blink Customer Service. They have been absolutely great to work with and actually keep in contact with you throughout the process.My doorbells are up and working as they should and for the money are a great deal. Picture quality is perfect and now I just need someone to ring the bell. Thank you Blink for your help!!", "Mounting is near impossible. Live view works when it feels like it. Tech support is horrible. I have never had to call Tech support 5 times in the first 30 days til now. Camera is hardwired in yet they tried to tell me the batteries were dead, in only 20 days, fine, new batteries (lithium) installed, 2 days later, batteries dead again... seriously? Wait an hour and suddenly the batteries are fine. I feel like I paid to work out the problems for them. I would love to see how many returns Amazon is getting for this junk. Wait a couple years, then maybe purchase.", "Ive been waiting for Blink to come out with a doorbell since they initially released their cameras. I pre ordered first chance I got. I have several blink cameras already, a couple of the full size ones and one of the finicky smaller ones. I had a Ring and wanted to replace it with a blink device since I already have the existing devices.I had hoped it would be better than the smaller indoor cameras and as good as their larger cameras and I was pleasantly surprised. pictures/video is good quality and I have not noticed any issues with it. The doorbell itself is louder than the Ring doorbell I replaced and does not have any issues working the mechanical doorbell that's in the house.Installation was simple/straightforward. I did not have to use a wedge so I did not come across any of the issues that others had encountered with that. Locking the device in place was a bit difficult as there was not a lot of travel to slide the device into place and little to no audible snap indicating it was locked. Had to pull on the thing to make sure it was locked in place and didn't come off.The real issue came with setup. Once the device was installed and added to my system, it needed a lot of settings adjustment to get right. I have my device wired so battery drain wasn't an issue but I can see why people were showing low battery shortly after installation. The door bell motion sensor kept activating every 5 min or so and recording. Once all the settings were dialed it worked better than the existing cameras. There was also a review that stated video wasn't recording, and that was probably due to the setting being off. I had the same issue but figured it out. The doorbell has different settings than the cameras and video recording has to be enabled towards the bottom of the setting screen. This is probably off to start in order to help people save battery at the start.The Blink system itself still has its issues: time limited clips, 10s re-trigger time for video recording, long delay in live view, and delay in video viewing. These all existed in the blink system prior to the doorbell so these are nothing new. I think these are built in to keep the cameras from overheating and preventing filling up cloud memory. Just things to keep in mind if you don't have a Blink device yet.The doorbell does what it supposed to do. Rings the bell when the button is pressed, detects motion and gives notification if you have that setting on, and records motion/doorbell rings when recording video setting is on. Solid video doorbell choice, especially for the price.", "Don\u2019t waste your money. This product and the \u201csupport\u201d team are complete trash. Spent two days working with tech support, could never get it to record video via motion detection or by ringing the doorbell button. I have two other blink cameras and they work fine, the doorbell is a complete miss. I should have listened to the reviews. I use the local storage USB. The only way the doorbell would record video was if you used the cloud & paid the monthly fee. Complete scam.", "Just got product delivered today so I can\u2019t talk more then owning it for 3 hours. But my setup on app was very easy. Installation where old doorbell was very easy with no struggles at all. Very much recommend item to anymore with blink cameras. Will give a long term update after a few months of owning.", "It will not recognize the doorbell.  Have tried at least 20 times taking the battery in and out.  The customer support was great.  Still could not figure it out, but quick responses.  I finally changed it to a newer sync module of the 3 I had, that was the issue.  If you have an old sync module, that may be the issue.  UPDATED AGAIN, EATING BATTERIES, ALMOST NO VIDEO CLIPS, MISSED EXCHANGE DATE BY 2 DAYS, MEGA HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH, WASTED MANY HOURS.", "Maybe i\u2019m crazy, but my preconception of a video doorbell was an amazing futuristic smarthome experience where, when someone pushes the button, I would get notified on my phone and could see who is there and talk with them via an intercom feature. If I happen to have a video home assistant like the echo show, then even better! It would immediately pop up with a live view showing who is at the door and allow me to talk with them.Disappointingly and to my utter shock and dismay, the blink video doorbell does none of those things.NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!What, Amazon and the Blink team, are we supposed to do with this then? It\u2019s a security camera. Sure. But it\u2019s definitely not a video doorbell.You have the resources and the talent to do better. This is a joke.", "I don't wanna praise it too high just yet because I have only used it for couple weeks. Easy to set up by following simple instructions. I hard wired it but initially it says to insert batteries. After that it doesn't say to remove batteries or not so I left them installed. I would prefer that the scan code also be put on the box it came with incase I had to reset in the future. You will have to pull it off the wall if you ever have to scan the code on the back of the doorbell.I tested it on my doorbell wire and received a warning that the voltage was too low. My thinking is that a lower voltage is better than too high of one so I left it hard wired.Alerts early enough and almost too sensitive. I think the sensitivity can be adjusted on your phone app. I set it up to my Alexa through the Alexa app and home security feature. I can't see a constant picture display like on my other blink cameras (just a blank screen) but when I open the app, video will turn on and also when someone is at the door. A signal is sent to your phone first.I can answer the door through my phone but it makes a high pitched sound and tough to understand. If I tell Alexa to \" show my doorbell\" the TV turns on and doorbell video can be observed ( I like this feature).  Alerts go off alot at night so I put it on silent or turn off. It catches all the passing cars on my street. Night vision is ok as most cameras only display black and white but I can still make out who or what is out front. You get a cloud account to try for 30 days and is compatible with your existing blink system. I will use a USB stick when my trial is over but I have not had a drop in signal or any problems with it since I installed this item. I recommend this to anyone since I have enjoyed it so much. Great item to purchase for Christmas. One last point is that I can not adjust the volume on the doorbell chime but I can have it in sequence with my hardwired chime. A ++", "Received my door bell kit. For the most part the instructions and installation match perfectly, until you try to make the connection between the door bell and the base mount. Absolutely impossible with the silicone seal designed to keep unit sealed and moisture out. Tried for about 45 mins to make a connection, not happening, until you remove the silicone seal and the unit attached easily and clicked into place. My suggestion is to redesign the until to match the cameras ease of access. Maybe a screw on top and bottom to match up. Definitely need a redesign to correct this issue. The tool provided is another terrible idea. This wouldn't be necessary if you simply had screws to remove. Lose the tool, you're screwed.", "Been a week and it doesn't work with any of the Echos let alone the Echo Shows, so really it is a doorbell that sends me a mobile alert if it is pushed. Defeats the entire purpose of buying this doorbell...1st Edit: Support contacted me to troubleshoot and set up a time to speak over the phone and resolve the issues. They had me schedule a time to call and then they never called. So I guess the support you receive with the products is also 1 star.", "I\u2019ve had multiple indoor and outdoor Blink cameras for years, so adding the Blink doorbell made the best sense for me.  In addition to added security, I was interested in the ability to know who and when someone was at the front door as I can\u2019t hear folks knocking from the upper level or back of the house.I\u2019m a very handy person who requires little instruction to figure things out.  This thing had me puzzled for about an hour as to why it wouldn\u2019t simply click together.  It\u2019s clear from the design how the parts are to connect\u2026 but they don\u2019t just snap together for testing or confirming you are assembling/installing correctly.Initial installation of the doorbell left it barely in the mount and ready to fall off with the slightest touch\u2014 obviously not ideal for how a doorbell is used. Just before I was ready click the send button for a product complaint to Blink (they provided excellent service with a camera issue in the past), I did some research on Amazon reviews.  The one that says something like \u201cread this first\u201d helped me solve the problem.Part of the issue was that I had left just a little bit of give in the screws to make it easier to remove the mounting plate if something was wrong with placement or installation. 1) The screws to the mounting plate must be tight!  When you are ready to place the doorbell into the plate, 2) look at the plate from the side (if possible) to help line up the back of the doorbell with the small cleats on the plate 3) hold the doorbell slightly above the cleats 4) push hard towards the plate and down to lock the cleats in.  There isn\u2019t a tell tale click sound\u2026 but when it\u2019s in there\u2026 you will know because it is definitely tightly affixed.So far, it\u2019s working very well.  The only other thing I would add is to check the view the doorbell provides before you install it.  Check to make sure there are minimal to no obstructions so you can maximize the security features.  Also look for options that give you the view you need.  For example, if you\u2019re wanting to keep an eye on packages on the front step, you may need to place it a little lower than you might think to.Like my other Blink products, adding the doorbell to my system and the rest of the installation process was easy.  Having an older home and not wanting to spend hundred of dollars on wiring\u2026I appreciate the ability to place and move these cameras wherever I need to with the non-wired options.  Overall, I\u2019m happy with my purchase.", "First, I am a big fan of the Blink ecosystem. I have 5 cameras with 2 more on the way. I've been patiently waiting for this Blink doorbell for a while now.Let's get the bad out of the way first: the mounting system. IT'S HORRIBLE! Whoever designed this mounting system should be fired. It's seriously that bad. I tried for nearly an hour to get the doorbell to connect properly to the mount but could not succeed. I read numerous other reviews giving tips on how to do it properly, none of them worked. I put just about all of my strength into making this doorbell \"click\" onto the base to securely fit and could not make it happen. What this ended up with was a fit that did not look weather proof and it certainly wasn't thief proof. Just a little bit of upward pressure was all it took to disconnect the doorbell from the mounting plate. Terrible.The image quality of the camera is decent. It's nothing amazing, but it's not the worst it could be. For a $50 doorbell it seems about right for the price.Maybe I got a faulty doorbell? Who knows? I do know this mounting system is one of the worst things I have come across on an Amazon product. I wanted to like this doorbell so badly but the entire thing is ruined by this awful mounting system. It's unbelievable nobody noticed this during development.Returned for refund the same day I received it. Just not worth the aggravation.", "UPDATE:I have upgraded my review from 2 stars to 3.I agree with others that the wall mount is cumbersome. Also, it is made with plastic.I don't know about the rest of the country, but in Arizona summer heat, even in the shade those little plastic hooks will become brittle in less than a year and snap off the next time I have to replace the batteries and remount the doorbell. What will I do then?It really could have, and should have been designed better.Also, the unit still can't capture far enough down to see the ground, which is more important than being able to see 10 feet in the air. It really should have been angled down a little bit.So for now, I have to keep my Blink XT camera above the front door to check for packages left on the ground.---------------------------------------Original Review:  The unit comes with batteries and the ability to connect into the existing low voltage doorbell wiring. However, the doorbell won\u2019t work with just the wiring alone. It requires the lithium batteries as well. Nor does it ring your house doorbell. But it does ring on your phone, so that part is good.It\u2019s good that it works nicely with my Blink app where I have 4 Blink XT cameras being monitored.But something odd happened with a video capture the doorbell took, where it gave me like 12-15 scenes together of the change of daylight and nighttime over the course of 24 hours. Almost like a timelapse video. Why?Still waiting for my corner mount. Right now, I get a big column. (See pic)Also, the camera is high enough to where I can\u2019t see the ground in front of the camera, for any packages left on the ground. I don\u2019t need to see 10 feet in the air.Some improvements could be made in this doorbell.", "Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration-:-Loaded:0%Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:001xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.I\u2019ve had 1 other video doorbell and this one is way better. Easy set up and clear HD video. Connects to my existing wired doorbell inside the house too. If you have a blink system already, this is the one to get.", "As some noted, there is a bit of an issue with the mounting plate, but that issue can be easily fixed by reading the instructions that show how to actually mount the plate.The doorbell is generally of good quality and there isn\u2019t a sense that it can be easily swiped, although I\u2019m sure some thugs will prove some users wrong. Video quality is great during the day and the audio transmission is good as well. Night time video is generally just ok. The glare from the cars on the road is sometimes enough to set off the ring camera alert at night, even when you set up your active zones to monitor. So lowering the sensitivity is a must.One other thing - the chime is automatically set to off meaning if you are wiring this in place of your typical doorbell, you\u2019ll have to go into the app and set your chime after you\u2019ve installed the doorbell. I think that should be automatically on since\u2026well since it\u2019s a doorbell, but who am I to judge. It\u2019s an easy fix.Overall I\u2019ve been impressed with all blink products and I\u2019m happy that they\u2019ve been making some changes and upgrades over the years.", "Frustrated, frustrated, frustrated. I installed my new doorbell without wiring on a flat surface following the instructions and video. I lined up the doorbell module with the plate and no amount of effort on my part was going to cause the two pieces to join together to give me a working doorbell. The doorbell is well protected by a porch.I had to wait till my son, a professional AV install technician, could swing by and complete the task for me. Less than a week later the doorbell has gone offline during our second Nor'Easter of the season. The solution to get it working again involves removing the doorbell module, the batteries (to power cycle the doorbell) and putting it back together again. ARE YOU SERIOUS???BLINK knows there is an issue connecting the module to the plate. They sell a separate spacer to correct for that. Why not include it in the product? Maybe you could engineer the face plate better so a spacer isn't needed? Or perhaps you could let people know up front that they may need assistance getting the two parts to connect if they're over a certain age and don't lift weights on a daily basis.Other than that, it works great.", "first this is not my first blink product, I have 6 indoor and outdoor cameras. i have shared my experiences with them and gotten many other families to buy the cameras (20+). i have nothing but positive reviews for the cameras BUT BUT BUT<--- this doorbell camera is not what I wanted. their \"wired\" option does not power the device, more did it function with my existing doorbell system, so I directly contacted blink and asked them what doorbell kit I should buy to properly power and use this device. their official response was \"we don't recommend any doorbell kits to use with our product.\" so they sell me a product with no way to know whose products will work with it. a wired option that doesn't power it, and once mounted is held on by 4 tiny plastic tabs smaller than a B.B that ill have to pray wouldn't break after opening every 6 months to replace batteries. no thanks. as for the range. it doesn't even catch me parking in front of the door. the trigger range is about 15 feet from the door and if its dark outside. 5 feet. i should of spent the extra money on a Ring doorbell.", "I'm sending this back and very disappointed with Amazon's advertising team. They make it sound like this can be used as a wired installation leading the reader to think that is what powers the unit. NOT true. As I dug into the installation, I discovered the batteries are actually the sole power source for the unit, whether wired or not. From their instructions on the website, it states, \"Batteries are always the main power source, even when the Blink Video Doorbell is connected to powered wiring from an existing doorbell system.\"This means there is no way I will see more than a few months on the batteries where it's in the main traffic area for people coming and going. I use a blink camera now to monitor the door and batteries last maybe 6 months with minimum video lengths, low lighting, and restricted zone setting outside the door area. Super disappointed that this isn't disclosed more clearly.To Blink: WTH were you thinking when designing this product to run on batteries at the entrance to a home? Seriously?", "The doorbell works fine. The video quality is acceptable. The motion detection is awful! It can\u2019t see a UPS or FedEx truck drive up but it catches every little bug that goes by or even falling leaves. In addition, if you don\u2019t pay for a subscription, they disable recording of live views to your installed USB drive! I\u2019ve had a couple of free months of subscription that you get with each new device so I know how it works with a subscription and without. When you get a new system you get 30 days total even if the system has ten devices! Yet buy one more camera and you get another 30 days. With the installation of the doorbell, I got another 30 days. When I had no subscription I could record all motion videos to my USB drive. Not live views. Now, with the doorbell and the free 30 days, I can record live views but it\u2019s stopped backing up the motion recordings to the drive as it had right up until the moment I installed the doorbell and started the new 30-day trial. My experience with Blink support has been dismal as well.", "We can not change door bell sound. Only one sound is supported which is ugly. only for sound, I took two stars.Will wait for Blink to support multiple sounds so that I can change it.Another thing is, can't put back cover easily while holding in hand.. I did not try installing to wall yet, may be that will give enough pressure to lock things in place.If Blink app can support a way to share cameras with others instead of whole account would be great.Above things are my expectations from Blink team.I have Blink wireless cameras from long time, they work flawlessly and battery comes for nearly two years and won't miss a single motion detection.", "The blink doorbell looks very much like others. It takes a good picture and the ability to ring our existing doorbell is a plus. Connecting the camera is similar to their other products. Everything went well during the installation up to mounting the button/camera to the wall mount. It was very frustrating trying to get the unit to \"Snap on with minimal pressure\" as the directions claimed. I had to repeatedly remove the plate and remount it before I got it to \"snap on\". I was afraid I was going to break the tiny plastic clips that hold it together. This feature needs rework to make it fit better. Another issue was a \"corner\" mount that was mentioned in the install instructions but was not in the box. I think that piece might have provided a better base and made snaping the plate to the camera easier.I will update this in a month after I have had some experience with the product.", "This is a piece of crap\u2026 I installed it day one of receiving and first, the connection to the wall mount is incredibly flimsy and will not last outdoors without breaking. Second, the motion detection, which is why I bought the device in the first place, is non-functioning. Third, I had to sit in the holding cell on the support line for 20 minutes before someone answered, and they don\u2019t know anything about how to fix anything related to this device. Wow. Great job, Amazon! You continue to disappoint! At least you have developed some consistency.", "This is a nice looking doorcam. It has two WIFI channels with one communicating with the sync module (if you have one) and the other with your WIFI network directly (no need for the sync module).However, the camera failed to take a snapshot or show a liveview (with a \"Thumbnail failed\" error). Bought a second camera, and the same thing happened.Talked to tech support a couple of times. Not help.If lucky, the liveview will show up if someone presses the door bell; but it takes more than 10 seconds for the view to show up in the app.So I suspect either the dual WIFI channel somehow confused the camera communication of the server has an issue to handle the data.But the way, I could not get the door cam to work at all without the sync module. So not sure why the other WIFI channel is there at all.In sum, not a good doorcam. Bad luck so far.", "I've previously had both a Ring and August doorbell but since I bought Blink cameras I wanted to find a compatible doorbell.  When this was announced I preordered it.  I did arrive a week later than originally planned, but supply chain issues, etc.  Installation was quick and easy and it works well with my hardwired doorbell.  Video and audio quality is great, as it night vision.  If you're familiar with Blink cameras, you will have the same control over the settings for the doorbell that you would for any camera.  For me, the biggest feature is to include the doorbell and cameras into a single app, which is why I hope to see more products from Blink introduced.The only very minor downside is that I was sent coupon for a free corner mount so I could mount the doorbell at an angle.  The corner mount was only offered in black even though the camera I ordered was white.  From the angle one walks onto the porch and approaches the doorbell from, you don't see it, but it would be nice if they offered the corner mount in the same color as the camera I ordered.", "Overall pleased with this doorbell camera.A few things I would change and make others aware of however:1. Item should come with a leveling kit. I didn't know until installing I may need to purchase a wedge or corner adapter. The corner is one thing, but most people will be installing this onto siding and will need a \"wedge\" to level the doorbell.  IMO, it should be provided with the kit.2. Can link it to the wired chime in your house, which is fantastic, but also has it's own audible chime that is turned up to 11. If you are in your house with the door closed and Alexa playing Pantera on blast, you just might be able to hear this thing. A volume adjuster in the app would be nice. Scared the bejesus out of my FedEx driver.Other than that, big fan of all the Blink equipment and this joins that team. Thanks.", "Tried installing it, but I don't have a \"completely flat\" surface where my old doorbell used to be. In fact there is not a completely flat surface anywhere between my door and the brick wall. And the old doorbell wires are in this \"not flat\" space, so that is really the only place I can install it. Tried installing anyways but the doorbell won't attach to the mounting plate because 1) not a completely flat surface, 2) limited space between wall and door jamb, 3) terrible mounting plate design that makes it virtually impossible to get doorbell to click into mounting plate. Very dissatisfied with this product and it is being returned today. I suspect that anyone with an old house will have trouble with this one. And to make things worse, my old doorbell disintegrated when I removed it, so now I have to replace that too!", "Unfortunately, I am not impressed by the product so far.  It has many shortcomings that make it a useless product.Issue 1:  The iPhone application does not provide an audible chime/sound/alert when the doorbell button is pressed. The only notification provided is a text notification.  So, if you are not looking at your phone's screen, you will never know that somebody just rang the doorbell!!!Issue 2:  There is no chime add-on device available from the company.  The only option is to use an existing chime device from your wired doorbell.  This defeats the wireless installation.  Our hose never had a wired doorbell. So, this along with the previous issue I mentioned makes the product useless.Issue 3: The camera coverage is very bad.  I am not sure how the product website shows a picture of packages on the ground.  I have installed the video-doorbell directly on the front door at the height of about 4 ft above ground.  In this installation, the camera's field of view does not show anything within the 4 feet from the door. So, any packages or objects left closer than 5 ft from the door will not be visible by the camera!!! If I manually tilt the video doorbell at 45 degree angle, I can see from 2 ft away from the door. Using the optional wedge bracket is not going to be helpful either.I hope the company addresses these issues and provide better information on the limitation of the product.Good Luck.", "I believe the actual function of the unit is probably ok.The structural integrity of it is another story. I tried over an hour to mount the unit to the back mount, to no success.My frustration level at this point is a bit beyond reason. No response from tech support, impossible to get anyone from Blink on the phone, even for Amazon!NOT HAPPY", "I've been using 3 blink cameras with local storage (and no cloud subscription) for several months now with no issues. I installed the video doorbell on 10/29 and things initially worked fine (motion detection and recording to the free trial cloud subscription and to local storage). The next day, I cancelled the free trial as it wasn't needed and things seemed to be working fine. From that point on, the doorbell's motion detection and recording no longer worked. I could do everything else: live view, take a photo, change settings, answer a doorbell ring, but motion detection and recording no longer worked.I took the doorbell off the mount and removed the batteries to perform a \"hard reset\" but no luck. Email tech support was useless. After going thru basics like changing the recording clip length and 'are you sure motion detection is enabled?', I ran their special app to troubleshoot network issues.  Their recommendations were to disable the router firewall and to give separate names to the two frequency bands on my dual band router.I told them I was not going to disable the firewall as this was a basic security issue and besides, the 3 blink cameras had been working fine for months with my network configuration (and continue to do so).Having read in AnInSe's review that all videos first go to Blink's servers before being transferred to local storage, I believe there is a bug on the server side that prevents videos from going to local storage if you cancel the trial cloud subscription.**UPDATE**Three hours after posting this review, my doorbell's motion detection and recording started working after having been inoperable for three days. I did nothing on my end to fix it. I did not disable my firewall or set up separate network names for my dual band router as tech support had recommended. I had just left it mounted and running, hoping that it was either a firmware issue in the doorbell or a server side issue that Blink would eventually fix. Apparently they did.", "Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration-:-Loaded:0%Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:001xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.So I use 8 Blink outdoor cameras around my house, for both security and keeping an eye on my dogs.  While the Blink cameras are not the highest quality cameras you can buy,  they are adequate for my needs.  They are slow compared to the Ring cameras, especially when connecting to the Blink app on your phone so you can see live alerts immediately. But they are also a lot cheaper! It's also cheaper for the subscription plan,  choosing me $10 a month for unlimited devices to backup to the cloud.  I also use a USB memory stick with the Sync module for local backup.So wasn't expecting this doorbell camera to work as well as it does.  I was worried that it wouldn't work with my wired chime from the old doorbell. I disconnected the old doorbell,  then attached the two wires to the mounting plate for the Blink doorbell, easy so far.  Then I screwed the mounting plate in.Before mounting the doorbell, add the batteries to the doorbell camera and add the device via the Blink app. Just scan the code on the back of the device to add it quickly.  Mine synced in less than 30 seconds.  Then follow the install steps.  The wired chime inside your house and alerts on any of your echo devices will not work until you go through the whole setup in the Blink app. Took me a while to figure that out! Once I completed the setup in the app, pressing the doorbell activated the wired chime inside the house. Then the Alexa app on my phone told me the doorbell was available on the Blink SmartHome skill. Clicked the link for that and it showed you to set the doorbell camera to chime on your echo devices and you can even change the sound it uses. I have echo devices in all of my rooms,  so that made it even better!Now the quality compared to the Ring doorbell cameras is not the greatest, even at the highest settings but it is more than adequate for me. The Ring doorbells (at least the newer ones) have a wider angle lens that sees more but as you can see from the video I posted it works great fur what I need.  As I have 3 Blink cameras also watching the walkway to the door, and the driveway, in covered.  If all I was doing was using a single doorbell camera, I would have went with the Ring pro.Battery life: All Blink cameras include a set of Energizer lithium batteries.  Depending on the settings for your Blink cameras, including the doorbell camera, the battery life can vary heavily.  Blink says they can last for two years.  Well that's not gonna happen under any real world scenario! Some of the things that eat battery life the most... setting quality to high. I use medium in all my cameras. The video length for recording also can eat up battery life, as can IR intensity set to high.  I find low to medium actually looks better on most cameras. I will have to experiment with the doorbell camera to see how long batteries will last.  Most of my Blink cameras will last 4 to 6 months.  I bought the solar mount for two of the cameras in high use areas as I was replacing batteries every month abs they were mounted up high and wasn't convenient to replace batteries in those cameras.I have read forums where people use rechargeable batteries and they work fine,  even though Blink says not to. Probably a deal they worked out with Schick Technologies to get better prices on batteries.  \ud83d\ude04 Personally I dont care for rechargeable batteries, as it is just one more thing I have to keep track of. I bought a large stock of lithium Energizer batteries from Amazon and rechargeable batteries will never last as long. Just my preference, but you do you!", "This is a follow up review to a one star review that I gave on this doorbell camera. After submitting the one star, I was contacted by Blink about the review. Long story short, they provided me with a brand new camera free of charge. I also purchased the wedge mount which was super helpful as I was having extreme difficulty trying to mount the camera to vinyl siding. If you are having trouble mounting the camera I strongly recommend purchasing the wedge mount. As for the performance of the doorbell camera, just like the other  7 cameras I have installed....it's just \"OK\". The biggest flaw is the video quality at night time with an outdoor light shining nearby. Overall, I'm fortunate that Blink took care of me and happy with the doorbell camera.", "Let's start with the obvious reason to buy this doorbell: Integration with the Alexa ecosystem you already have in your house. For me I have Echo's, Echo Show, Blink Inside/Outside cameras(6 total), Halo Fitness Tracker(not really connected but still Amazon).Out of the box, batteries in, connect to the blink app-easy. Scan a bar code and good to go. Get a warning about having a Sync Module? No problem I have it.Doorbell \"No you don't\".Um..yes I do, all of the cameras could tell you the same.So first red flag is it refuses to acknowledge my sync module.  A handful of powering off module, router, camera in different combinations-it finally seems to see it....ok first 40 minutes gone.Next remove the Ring doorbell that's hardwired in with no issues in a full year of use to wire in the Blink doorbell. \"Your transformer doesn't seem to be compatible\". Hmmm...double check the fine print, specs, requirements..yeah-yeah it is. Ok, kill the breaker, unhook, re-hook, breaker on...nope...Hook the ring doorbell back up(requires the exact same power as Blink)-works fine.Ok...so poof bang pow(get the blink wired back up, reset router and sync module) \"your transformer is perfect! way to go big guy\".Alrighty...Alexa app shows video, Echo Show-video check. Neat.Now for the purpose...ring the doorbell...crickets chirp...So 60+ minutes into it I go back through all the settings, test chime works fine, bell chimes on the doorbell itself, but not outside the app or the doorbell. Triple check settings...Echo's enabled as chimes...Reset router, sync module again...and again.75th time is the charm! It finally works....kinda? 90 minutes in...The shortest latency period I could manage was 43 seconds from doorbell push to echo notifications.Go ahead...hold your breath for 43 seconds...see if you're hanging out at my door that long before I even know you're there.My sync module, wireless router, anything that matters are all centrally located in my home, over 150mb speed even at the heaviest of streaming/download times. My Ring doorbell has zero issues. It does everything the Blink camera does(but actually does them). It only requires me to have an extra app on my phone.Save your time and hold off until Amazon wants to ship a functioning doorbell.(Before jumping to conclusions on my level of interaction with support staff....yes all the power up/down/unplug/plug-in, reset app, delete doorbell, hard reset module, is what hoops you'll be jumping through).", "*Update* After about a week of using it there was a firmware update that fixed the chime volume at the doorbell and it's now silent. Customer service was very responsive and followed up to confirm the issue is resolved. The view and installation issues remain though so I'll update from 2 to 3 stars for now (the installation issues only seem fixable with a new design of the physical hardware).*Original Review*I was over the moon when the release of this long awaited doorbell was finally announced! I've been waiting to get rid of those terrible Ring doorbells and replace them with this.I have to say though, the only saving grace for this is the long battery life (Ring's are horrible even with all motion features turned off). With so much development time and delay under its belt, I would have expected more. Some details:* Mounting experience is horrible. I don't know what product design was thinking but that backplate you have to press the device on to is something else. You have to press really hard and push up, and there's not much feedback to see if it's secure or not.* I saw a feature in the app to turn off the ringer - which I like to do, what's the point of the outside person hearing a chime anyway. Unfortunately, this doesn't work - at all. When I asked customer service, after two back and forth exchanges, they finally admitted (and I quote) \"Seems like the ringer volume on doorbell settings is not fully functional since this is a newly added feature on the app\". Oh you figured that out when a customer told you? Shouldn't you have found this during your own testing? I'm not impressed.* With the Ring ones, I can see a picture of who's at the door on relevant Alexa devices with a screen. This one for some reason doesn't do that although it does announce that someone's at the door.* I have two doorbells, front and back door, and although they're both connected with a corresponding unique name, all Alexa does when someone rings the doorbell is \"Someone's at the Blink Doorbell\". Well, which one is what I would like to know - why can that integration not be fixed to actually use the designated label or name of the device?I do understand there will be feature and maybe some quality differences between a low price segment device such as this and more expensive ones such as the Ring range, but honestly if it weren't for the long battery life there'd be virtually no difference to me in terms of functionality (they both are bad). Honestly, for how long we've been waiting for the doorbell, and assuming it's undergone a fair amount of development since the original announcement, this product is a bit of a disappointment. One can't help but wonder, given they're both from the same parent company, if it's almost designed to push you to the more expensive range, but then why put effort into development in the first place.", "Overall, for the value you get and the features I would recommend the doorbell because it isn't horrible.  I'm coming from a Ring Video doorbell 2 because I don't want to pay for recorded videos of people I have missed.  It only allows you live views, which is garbage!  I installed and am currently running on battery vs wired.  Integration with my existing Blink ecosystem was seamless and easy enough to do.  If you have an existing synch module, then you already know how to operate and setup things from the app.  All the features I had from the Blink mini and outdoor camera are the same, so there isn't a learning curve there.  I appreciate the fact that I can store motion videos in the cloud for free with the legacy synch module and don't have to pay for this service.  Maybe that will change in future?  I also like that I can upgrade the module to use store video on an external SD card locally and still not pay for cloud service.  Haven't used this feature yet, so I cannot comment on it. As you would imagine Alexa integration works fine as well, so alerts and door bell rings can be pushed to your Alexa powered devices.Now for the bad as I guess you get what you pay for.  The Blink outdoor and mini are easily 5 stars, but doorbell not so much. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because of a few things:1) the build quality is not the same as a Ring doorbell for example. Feels a little cheap and the mounting bracket and angle mounting brack are very cheap thin plastic.2) the release mechanism from the mount is absolutely horrible. I see this being a big issue for longer term and see it breaking. This is probably not a problem for those that are hard wired, but for those running on battery and need to take the doorbell on/off this is not good design. I can pretty much guarantee you will need a new mounting bracket or even new doorbell after a few battery changes. Also, the tool you use to detach the doorbell is hard to use and takes a little jiggling around to unmount the doorbell.3) there isn't a quick start guide and everything is online or in the Blink app so get it SETUP with the synch module BEFORE you try to mount!That's all I have for now.  Will update on battery life and if quality makes it past a harsh Winter and/or blistering Summer.", "I purchased the Blink Video Doorbell + Sync Module 2 and Blink Video Doorbell Corner Mount. The Blink itself came with a corner mount, so buying the extra corner mount wasn't necessary. (It probably said that somewhere, but I don't remember reading that). Overall great product and I plan to buy more for the ret of my home.Likes: Easy setup for the sync module and doorbell itself. The app works well and the directions were easy to follow along. The app is nice. Easy to use. Once we set it up, it worked perfectly. We get notifications for any activity. The voice function works well.Dislikes: so-so installation. The directions could have had more details. I'm not sure if it exists, but a video installation would be helpful. One disadvantage is that you have to buy a subscription service.", "If you are like me, you will likely buy this doorbell if you already own a blink system.  If you are also like me, you will want to return it when you find out it won\u2019t store videos to your sync module like all of your other cameras and requires a subscription to Amazon cloud to do anything other than live stream.  Quite the depressing user experience", "So after waiting an EXTRA long time to get the white Blink Video Doorbell, I set out to install it in place of my existing doorbell.  I already knew I had a low voltage system so no worries there.  Doorbells aren't complicated.  It's a simple switch that closes a circuit to trigger the ringer.  Blink allows the installation in a wired or wireless format. The wireless install is no different than any other Blink camera.Installation was pretty straightforward but getting the mount to \"lock\" into the doorbell took some persuasion.  There's no positive \"click\" feeling when the mount and camera are fully seated.  After hastily removing my old doorbell button and hooking up the Blink, I didn't understand why it wasn't working.  Lo and behold, during the initial addition of the Video Doorbell to your system hub, there's a walkthrough on setting it up.  I skipped that because I got interrupted by something else (squirrel!) and didn't realize it was an important step.So once I was sure everything was mounted correctly, I went into the Video Doorbell settings and configured it for a powered, mechanical chime.  The doorbell firmware did its thing and got everything working correctly.  Very nice, Blink devs.The video quality is exceptional and it's super wide angle.  The motion sensitivity is great and it catches cars going by over 50 feet away.  Night vision is excellent.There is some delay on the talk/listen feature, however.  I would argue that it's almost unusable but will hold out judgment until I've used it a little more.  It is, however, clear and very functional.Amazon provided a coupon code for the wedge mount because it wasn't included with the first run of these units.  Thanks, Amazon.I had been tracking this for what seems like years and I'm happy Amazon/Blink finally released it.  I'd argue that it's the pinnacle of my ten camera Blink installation.", "This thing was pretty much plug and play. I already live in the Amazon ecosystem, so it took no time at all to get this set up. The picture looks good, and it is easy to tell everything you're looking at. I saw a few comments about people having issues with the motion sensor, but I haven't had this issue, and kinda surprised that it doesn't go off every time a car goes down the street or a cat walks by, but definitely comes on when a person walks through the yard. The microphone isn't amazing, and the person at the door has to talk louder in order for you to hear them properly, but it's not unusable by any means. The backplate that holds the batteries was defective in mine, but I contacted Blink and they had a replacement here in 2 days, so good on them. The mounting is \"meat and potatoes\" unless you want a super specific angle.The only reason that I'm knocking a star off is because the local backup only supports 256GB flash drives. I bought a 2 TB external USB HDD for the backup, and can't use it. I found where it stated this on the website but; A. It was something that was not easy to find and; B. This is a small amount when you are talking about recording video and audio. This means that in order to clear the drive, you are going to have to unplug it and delete everything manually, and often. Cmon, Jeff. It's 2021, and we can only use 256 GB? Kinda ridiculous...All in all, I'm happy with it. I'll be getting some of the cameras to sync with it and using the subscription service for the cloud storage. I've seen complaints about this by the way, but I don't feel like $10 a month unreasonable. If you don't like it, don't pay for it. People pay more than that for Netflix, and that does nothing to help secure you're house and property.", "I had a ring doorbell that I purchased from Costco a few months back. I liked it ok but then started having issues with the motion detection and the actual ringing of the bell. Saw this on a black Friday deal at a tremendous price difference for what I paid for my ring. It's pretty comparable to the ring. Has detection that you can turn up or down depending on how sensitive you want to keep it at. Mine was picking up my neighbor across the street putting up Christmas lights which was a little too much for me. So we lowered the sensitivity. It rings to my existing chime box in my house which if it didn't would have been a deal breaker for me. I'm old school. Like to hear that ding dong instead of having to have my phone only make the sound. I did order an echo show to connect it to so I can see who's at the door when I'm cooking or doing something where I don't have my phone right next to me. Still waiting on delivery of that. It's still on back order I'm assuming because it was at such a great sale price last week. Hope that works out. The bell itself is very sleek looking. Fits on my door nicely although I must say I have it to the side so I needed to order the tilt bracket so it would face my steps properly. But that was only $7. No biggie. No issues installing or putting backing on like others have said. There is a tool in the box that helps with that. So far so good. Definitely a more cost effective alternative to a ring and so far to me this is superior to ring. If you are deciding between this and ring, especially at the price point, I say go with blink.", "I have been using the Blink cameras for several years and I have always liked them. When I got the pre-order notification for the doorbell I immediately placed an order.I am more than satisfied with the video quality and settings of the device, the video is crisp and clear but of course you can adjust these settings to suit your individual preferences. Whether you want to preserve battery life or sacrifice it in spite of video quality and consistent monitoring of your home is up to you.I mounted mine with batteries as opposed to hard wiring, I also used the corner mount which had to be ordered separately (oddly) for free with a code provided by Amazon.The installation took maybe 5 minutes, it was simple and instructions are provided. Keep in mind that, to lock the doorbell in place you need to press hard. Remember, the device will be exposed to the elements and possibly tampering so it needs to be sealed tight. DO NOT throw away the small key provided in the box as you will need it in order to remove your device for whatever reason.The chime sound it emits when the doorbell button is pressed, is definitely audible and the speaker is loud and clear. The motion activation works as it should. I tested mine with a grocery delivery and the person was definitely spooked when they heard my voice, but I was glad it worked as the delivery person was not sure if it was the right home and their app was not working at the time, so we were able to communicate through the Blink doorbell. I\u2019d say it\u2019s totally worth it.", "I've probably had this doorbell on and off the wall a good 20 times to get it setup. For starters, it's basically mandatory to have wired power from the house. It's useless without it, even though it comes with batteries. The lithium name brand batteries it came with failed in less than a week and any other batteries I use produce a low battery indicator in the user interface. Anytime I dismount the unit to address these issues I have to hit the reset button on the back, rediscover my wifi and re-enter the password, very irritating. Like the other blink devices you have to manually go through every motion notice to clear the notifications. I should have the option to clear them all. This is super irritating when you have a lot of movement like family visiting, and you see 178 notifications in the app. You also can't disarm just one camera, it's either all or none. The doorbell will go off when the cat walks by but if someone legitimately comes to the door it magically doesn't work for whatever reason. I've yet to have it successfully tell me when someone is at the door and also ring when they press it. It should do both. It also had an episode where it just wouldn't work with the alexas I set up. I had to reinstall the system to get it to connect to the alexas again. I really wish this thing was just plug and play but it's buggy and I've spent way too much time fiddling with it. I'm writing this review because 30 minutes ago someone came to the door and it failed to announce the movement and it failed to ring when they pressed the button. They had to knock. I check my other camera and I see the person press the button and just stand there wondering why nobody came to the door. But I bet 100 dollars tonight in my sleep the cat will trip the motion and my alexa will wake me up. And then the next day a delivery will come and nothing will happen. Should have gone with the Ring, you know, the device Blink is ripping off.", "I may update this later.  Overall the blink system does what it says it does.  Since I just installed, and am still tweaking, it we will see about the battery life.  This system is very easy to install and set up.  There are instructions in the phone app to assist in mounting the doorbell.  There are a couple of things that are not so great though.  One is the mount for the additional camera.  The one that comes with it is garbage.  It is a friction fit that does not fit.  I wonder how many people have broken it trying to mount the camera.  I found an add on mount here which works very well.The other concern I have is with the motion detection and clip length.  I currently have the motion sensitivity set to 6 for both the doorbell and the camera.  The doorbell does well at picking up motion (i.e. cars driving by) albeit late.  Often the clip will start with the car 3/4 of the way across the view.  The other camera I have mounted on the opposite side of my garage from the doorbell.  There have been multiple instances so far where the doorbell camera picks up and records motion but the additional camera does not.The clip length is adjustable but finite.  The one thing I think would be nice is the option to have the camera continue recording as long as there is motion.  As it is the maximum clip length is 60 seconds with a minimum pause of 10 seconds before it starts again.  I would love the ability to set clip length to 10-15 seconds with the option to keep recording if there is still motion present.", "With high expectation and good experience with Blink's products, mostly cameras for us, we looked forward to add the Blink Doorbell to complement the system we have.  The package came in with Amazon good, and the design on the package, graphic and all, even with a key, are good and thoughtful, the unit also seems to be working nicely as expected. After adding this doorbell unit to the phone app., we completed the software part, and started to test the unit, which seems to work just fine with camera and video recording good.  Then, after installing the back-plate to the outside wall, and tried to snap the unit onto the back-plate, as according to the instruction JIF and manual, the unit just cannot be snap into place into the back plate, after a frustrating hour to nudge and press with different degree of force and angles, the doorbell unit simple cannot be snap into place onto the backplate !!  It seems to be a design flaw somehow, that the only one time we can finally snap the doorbell unit into the backplate was, after we took the backplate out, frustratingly, and use thumb to press the backplate onto the doorbell unit!! NOTE: The force was applied from the inside, from the backplate onto the doorbell, not the way from the doorbell to the backplate as designed!  it was \"impossible\" for us to press and snap when the backplate is on the wall.  So, we hope the Blink team can look into this flaw and redesign the snap mechanism, with a better built back plate to complement the fine doorbell itself....Major Disappointment!", "Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration-:-Loaded:0%Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:001xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionsCaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.I had this doorbell installed 2 days ago & after making adjustments to my settings on the Blink Home Monitoring app & Alexa I am surprisingly happy with my purchase. I already own several on the Blink Indoor cameras my for kids room & my living room entry way, so I expected expected there to be a 5-10 second lag in video display but after connecting to my Alexa app things started to look up. I live in an older house so the doorbell that's already installed sometimes goes on the fritz so I decided to install the video doorbell right above the existing one wirelessly & I was unsure of how getting alerts or hearing the doorbell was would be possible, but I ended up setting my Video Doorbell to a high sensitivity level (which will definitely mess with the battery life) so it alerts me of any movements but I have since decreased the sensitivity since then. As far as the lag goes it does not effect anything especially while the doorbell is armed it records as soon as someone approaches the general area or touches the doorbell & immediately starts recording. The 2 way talk is always a plus. Overall the camera & quality is awesome & I would recommend if you are looking for a cheaper video doorbell with good quality! Oan: installation was a breeze no mounting issues.", "Installation was plain and simple.  I didn't have an existing doorbell, so I had to go with the battery only install (my old system was an intercom systems from days gone by, and no schematic to show how to grab required power from it).  I mounted it flush on my front door, and it was detected and integrated into Alexa with almost no problem.  Then the notices of movement started...and continued...again, and again.  During the day, I have my system armed to get motion detection on my (hardwired) Blink cameras.  The doorbell camera captured every neighbor, UPS, Fedex, Amazon, and lawn service vehicle driving by.  Annoying, and figure it'll go thru batteries at a stupid rate.  There needs to be an option to only capture motion during specific hours (I'd LOVE to know if anyone were roaming around at night, after everyone is in bed, etc.) but there doesn't seem to be the flexibility to specify times for individual devices for motion detection.  It's either on for everything or not.  Disappointing.  So for now I've disabled it, and plan to write a product request to the Blink development team, which I fully expect to be ignored, about better ways to handle motion detection.  On the positive side, when the doorbell was pressed, I did get notification on the app and via Alexa, so there's something.", "$35 currently for the Blink doorbell unit only vs $60 for the Ring Wired (both amazon owned)We already have installed a Blink outdoor cam system so adding the Blink Doorbell was a no brainer.  And just in case we purchased a Ring Wired if the Blink unit was a fail - it is not.I have a wired doorbell now (house was built in '89) so install as a wired unit was pretty easy - I did also order and needed both the wedge and angle pieces (sold separately) Follow the instructions and easy peasy - done.When \"Armed\" motion detected will prompt your echo devise to say - Motion detected @ door bell or something(?)When Armed OR Disarmed and Doorbell button is pressed - My wired doorbell rings, the unit chimes, my phone chimes AND Echo devise states some is @ your doorbell(?)  so so far very happy.BLINK DOES NOT INTEGRATE WITH SMARTTHINGS - Ring DOES - this in not an issue for me.  about the only good thing of our Ring when we had it was its integration as a motion detector (Ring Pro) video was excellent but the latency was horrible and it's what 4-5x the cost of Blink.if you have Ring cams and need a doorbell - get the Ring (wired seems to be the best option now, or Pro)if you blink cams - get the Blink doorbellgood luck!", "So a customer service rep reached out and ended up sending me a new device. I had similar issues with the new one but finally a new mounting plate seems to have fixed the issue! I am finally up and running and at least after the first day, it seems to be a lot better!I think they could do a better job on the install hardware but once it's set up, it seems good so far![Previous Review] Sent this back after trying to install for two days. I am a techie who has built lots of PCs, 3D printers, fixed lawnmowers, etc. but I could not get this to mount correctly and even when it seemed like it was mounted, it wouldn't activate my indoor doorbell.Very disappointed in the whole process.", "I mistakenly believed that this would integrate well with my Echo Show device in a way that when someone rang the doorbell, the picture would automatically pop up on the Show device... That is not the case.  The audio alert comes quickly however and the phone notification comes quickly but it's still awkward to have to manually \"summon\" the camera to show you who is at the door.  That's just one of my disappointments.  Beyond that, why does the chime ring LOUDLY outside when someone rings the bell?  They don't need to hear it, I do!  Yet inside the house,  the ding is softer on both the echo show and the cell phone, and if you aren't in the same room as either of those devices, you are not going to hear it!  So overall it is an ill conceived device that has many shortcomings.  Unlike many, I did not have any mounting issues, but then I am handy with tools.  However for the price I will keep it for use as an additional on demand security camera, that works on same app as my Blink xt2 Cameras.  In fact it is at a  lower price point than the individual wireless Blink  outdoor cameras anyway, and does the same thing from what I see.  But it's pretty worthless as a \"video doorbell,\"  because its too much trouble to bring up the video or still picture.", "I ordered this because I have 3 Blink Cameras and a subscription already that could support more.  I also had  Ring subscription for my OG Ring Doorbell and figured I could save some $$$.Nice product - look and feel.  Easy install, for those that complained about how hard it was to snap the doorbell to the back plate - try a little silicon grease on the seal.  Snaps right on.The Good -  great picture and it rings the old school doorbell.  That's really about it I guess its a solid value for ~$50.  But...The Bad - it hooks up to the house wiring, but does NOT use that as a power source!? That makes no sense.  As I said I have 3 blink sec cameras on a dusk to dawn schedule.  Well after adding the doorbell, I assumed you could create different schedule.  You can't, so I ether have my door bell only armed at night :-/ or I have the other 3 cameras armed all day (and get a TON of movement notifications)  - Neither works.  Lastly, they include a little \"special key\" to remove the doorbell (remember you will have to change the batteries!).  Well a small screwdriver works just as well, so not really a key and some one could steal your door bell.These limitations may be fine for others it wasn't for me.Anyway - Like I said I really wanted this to work, but its going back and I am upgrading to a newer Ring.UPDATE 11/16/21 - I have upped this to 4 stars based on customer service and support(via email, the phone guys are trying but reading from a document so no real knowledge).  They couldn't fix any of the issues above, but did help solve the motion schedule issue(you need a 2nd Sync2 module).  They have been awesome at communication and when I had an issue with pink image sent a replacement in a day!and Yes I decided to keep it, for the back door.  The front (sorry to say) has a Ring Pro.", "I don\u2019t have any complaints that are dealbreakers at this price point. I wanted a doorbell which is what I got. I like that it can be connected to the echo show and alerts you that someone is at the door. Seems to be much quicker than the blink camera that was in the same area to alert you of motion. Especially the app. Alexa has a slight delay. If someone pushes the button, the Alexa  announcement is a couple seconds behind. The app takes you straight to live view if the notification is tapped and you are able to catch someone and talk to them before they walk away. Setting up a routine with the echo show will automatically open live view too if you choose. A little slower but not bad. Much faster then asking Alex to show you.Yes, getting the doorbell attached to the mounting plate took a minute to figure out but figure that\u2019s not a bad thing. At least it\u2019s secure.  People are a little dark in the video so assume some front light would help offset all of the backlight but you can make people out.I haven\u2019t had any other video doorbell and understand there\u2019s others that have more bells and whistles. I also don\u2019t have a regular doorbell either so adding this to a system I already have that is much cheaper than the others and alerts me when someone pushes the button is great!", "I've been part of the blink ecosystem for a long time, and always wanted a video doorbell, but i didn't want to have to deal with two apps and get one from [the other guys]. So glad this finally launched.Installation was super quick and easy. I have mine wired into the original doorbell, so it runs off wired power and uses my physical chime box that came with the house. Video quality is just like the XT2 or Mini cameras, and it's super responsive.  Build quality feels nice.", "I purchased the bundle containing the doorbell, snych module, and corner bracket (which I didn't need). The assembly instructions were a bit confusing, with several sets of often vague instructions available in printed and electronic form. But finally everything came together OK despite my spotty assembly skills.Attaching the doorbell to the door bracket was a bit tricky, as others have noted. I found that aligning the top of the doorbell with the top of the bracket so that they are touching, then pushing in and down works fairly smoothly. Removal of the doorbell with the supplied key is easy.The synch module readily logged into wifi and I had no difficulties with the phone app and video playback and storage. But it has only been a week. I plugged a flash drive into the synch module, so we'll see how that works for local storage when my free cloud subscription expires.All in all, a functional video doorbell at a good price--better if you bundle and get it on sale.

It's complete garbage if it takes me an hour to attach the camera to the backing.

It shouldn't be such a pain in the ass to setup from app download to physically attaching it. Get it together BLINK. I want to return it but I'm gonna have to macgyver this b!tch.UPDATE:Blink has very responsive reps that care about their products. I had a nice exchange for a replacement to be sent. Although I didn't require it since I figured out a way to stabilize the backing with my unit, I did mention that a customizable solution for when people are shopping online on Amazon can cater their backing mount options to their door. Blink offers an angled corner backing that I wasn't aware of and wasn't shown through search results via Amazon's algorithm. Just another option to look into if you don't have a flat surface near where you mount.", "I\u2019ve been waiting for Blink to have a doorbell to go with my extensive blink ecosystem.

My router & blink module are right on the other side of the wall. No change in static noise in all videos. Amazon sent me a replacement which I just installed. Fortunately it is a breeze to setup. Unfortunately the static is still there & slightly louder.I am keeping the doorbell because I love Blink, hoping that there will be a software update at some point to resolve the static sound.Also, Blink please update to allow the doorbell lighted ring to glow a bit at night. It is impossible to find it in the dark. All other video doorbell have the lighted circle.If those two things are resolved there is no reason to not recommend this unit.", "First, lets sum this up by saying this is a fantastic option for Alexa smart home users and Blink Users, for those familiar enough with the Amazon/Alexa ecosystem you can set this up many ways in your smart home. If your a Blink Camera Security user this is a no brainer. Installation is a breeze, I used my existing wires from my current hardwired doorbell and it worked perfect (Turn off power at the circuit breaker). Doorbell is pressed, the guest hears a chime at the doorbell itself, and the original indoor chime works on the wall as it always has. There is even the ability to adjust your electronic or piston based wall mounted powered doorbell from within the app to get the best sound from your bell (genius). That\u2019s the easy and straightforward part, this is when the fun begins. The doorbell itself can be set in various configurations. It can be set/armed along with your outdoor cameras and notify you as well as record when it senses motion, with the same settings to record as your standard cameras. You can also set and customize motion zones as well as privacy zones in it\u2019s field of view (nice features). IR intensity, recording time, trigger time, end recording early, it\u2019s all there. There are also a series of actions you can set for when the actual doorbell is pressed, or it sees motion. For example, if the doorbell senses motion at the door you can set Alexa devices in the house (you choose which ones) to announce that someone is at the front door, or in addition you can have it play one of a half dozen or more \u201cchimes\u201d that play right on the Alexa device of your choice which are selectable within the Alexa App (Echo speakers, Fire TV, Echo Video Screens, etc). For video enabled devices, you can also have the live video feed start automatically and you can enjoy two way audio as you speak with your visitor. This also works on your cell phone while away from the house. For those with Alexa \u201cAuto\u201d, these notifications can be set to announce there as well. For those looking to take things further, motion or a button press on the doorbell can also be used to set custom actions within your smart home, turning lights on, Changing a Hue light\u2019s color, etc.. you have many many actions. As an example, I have mine set to Turn on the front outside lights (at certain times of the day to give the visitor a visual cue that the house is aware they are there), I have Alexa play a customized notification on three Alexa devices in the house (Verbally announcing what I typed it to say, have fun with this one), and a custom Chime (in addition to my house doorbell). It also sends notifications to my phone, my car, and records the visitor. Original Blink buyers continue to enjoy free cloud storage as with their other cameras, and if you install and use the most recent sync module, you can choose to record locally for the doorbell off the USB port to a Drive. I also have the ability to answer the door either manually or if I set it automatically off the FireTV in the livingroom.. Bottom line, the Amazon ecosystem gives you an almost unlimited amount of customizations for your smart home if you choose, including the ability to automatically turn on outside and inside lights (you select which ones) when someone comes to the front door based on either motion, or a doorbell press. I find the video quality to be quiet good keeping in mind this is a fisheye setup, the IR light is strong enough for people at the door, daytime quality is great, sensitivity is great, sound is great. While there is a delay when speaking I find it more that acceptable (around 1-2 sec), much better than what you experience when using the outdoor cameras speaker function (Which do not provide two way audio like the doorbell). I would recommend those buying the camera to buy the wedge/corner mount to properly aim the camera towards where the person is likely to be standing, but this is not a must have depending on your door. I also found mounting to be very easy, secure (if they really want it they are going to get it, but your likely to have video of who took it anyway), and despite the negative comments about mounting the slide-on camera it was super easy and secure (not sure why some are having issues, there are no issues). Just another excellent addition to the BLINK offering.", "I bought this because I am already committed to the Blink Ecosystem (I have five cameras), so I figured this was a no-brainer.While it works pretty well, I'm less than impressed with the mounting.  Mine came with the corner tab (a must because my doorbell would otherwise be looking at the back of a decorative pillar), and the installation of the corner mount made the whole system a mess.  The mount screws make it kind of flimsy, and the doorbell unit itself was a pain to mount.  Sure, I could go buy other screws (which it looks like I will have to do, but it should have just been better designed.  The corner mount made the whole doorbell less than awesome as an experience.Also, the requirement that I need to press the doorbell to \"arm\" it after enabling it is poorly thought out.  I want to be able to arm/disarm my whole system remotely.  If I remember to arm it after-the-fact when I leave the house, it now will not work unless someone pushes the doorbell (or it waits a full 24 hours).  Not a good feature.", "UPDATE - Blink support reached out to me after my initial review and offered to send me a replacement free of charge.  They took the initial feedback seriously.  After receiving my second camera and mount, I installed the mount using my own screws meant for hardi-plank siding.  This worked fine.  When the mount bracket and back are solid and stable, the camera clicks on fairly easily.  Doorbell camera is now up and running.  It integrates nicely into my echo with video.I was able to wire it in the existing doorbell spot and it controls my chime as expected.I plan to use it for a while and then add more to the review.I'm changing my initial review from one to four stars.  I'm found this solely on the effort from support.  Haitham with Blink went above and beyond to make sure I got taken care of.  Much appreciated!!--- Original Review --Let me first say I've had blink cameras for almost three years now.  I've been happy with the blink system and camera function.I patiently waited for a doorbell to add to the system. I was excited when one finally was released.  Then I got it...First off, Amazon needs to realize that people mounting these with screws are likely putting them into fiberboard cement siding.  I got the angled mount (which should come with the camera but doesn't) and they give you two teeny tiny machine screws to mount it.  To your house.  So right away I had to go find different screws.  Fine.  No big deal.  Got it mounted and moved on.Next they tell you to mount the camera cover.  The hardware that they send for this job is so soft you can practically squish it between your thumb and finger!  Every turn of the screw you can just see the metal coming off.  By 6 or 7 turns, I couldn't tell it was a Phillips screw anymore.  When I got the bottom one snug, the head of the screw just broke clean off in the mount rendering it useless.I thought maybe I could make it work with one screw but like others mentioned you have to be Bobby Fischer to figure out how to get the camera to slide onto the back.  I tried several times and finally gave up, shoved it back in the box and returned it.  Save yourself a headache and just mount one of the outdoor cameras above your door.  This cheapo product is not worth the effort.", "I order this under preorder before reviews came out. But I did read the reviews about bad mounting over the last few weeks before it got here but kept my order today. I was hoping I would get one without the issues or with my background in Tech could find an easy fix...I can build computers and repair just about anything, But I was wrong. Sadly this product is just not ready for market. The like the software, app, and even the camera on this doorbell however the mount is the biggest miss here. This doorbell would get an easy 5 stars if the mount on the thing worked. After drilling holes and mounting it next to the front door the doorbell won't go on the mount no matter how you try it. I tried every other way to get this to fit into the hooks. Nope... If I wasn't so lazy I would return the product however I rigged the mount with double-sided tape and mounted it with command strips. Hopefully, it will hold and no one will try to rip it off. I really wanted to love this product.", "I really like the device.  I have to actually mount it.  It\u2019s is a bit confusing trying to understand the features.  It kept mentioning something about paying for a subscription which, is not what I want and something about a free 30 day trial not really sure what that\u2019s all about.  I am able to use it at this time and if it doesn\u2019t work I guess I will update the review.  The night vision is on point as soon as it noticed low or dim light the night vision feature turns on right away.  The motion detection is amazing it\u2019s all real time.  Definitely with the buy especially for the price", "I just installed my Blink Doorbell and it is WONDERFUL!!!  I did the wireless installation.  I had some problems in the beginning because I wasn't getting notifications on my iphone. But, I called customer service and they were GREAT!  The guy walked me through every step and now it is all PERFECT!!  I love that you can use the microphone even if the person doesn't actually ring the doorbell.  Might have some fun with that next Halloween!!  It is even more wonderful than I expected! I already had the Blink module and 4 cameras. I've had those for years...keeping an eye on my cats!  Now, I have the Blink Doorbell and I couldn't be happier!", "When someone rings the doorbell, it tells you on your phone and the Echo makes a sound (like any doorbell), however it doesn't show the video until you ask it to.  When you ask it to show the video, it takes another 10 seconds to load the video.  Seems like by the time you get to Alexa & ask to see the video & it finally loads, the  person at the door has already left.  Pointless.You are able to create a \"Routine\" that will show the doorbell automatically, but it won't stop showing the doorbell video until you ask it to stop.  There doesn't seem to be a way to tell it to show a finite amount of video, as the \"show me the doorbell\" command has to be the last one.If what you want is a motion detection camera, this does the trick.  If you were expecting this to be a video doorbell when combined with an echo, then I give it 1 star.I updated to 3 stars based on interaction with tech support - they definitely stand by their products.", "I've had the Blink wireless outdoor camera for about a year now.  Love that thing.  I've never had to replace the batteries in it since we purchased it.  Motion detection works great, storage is wonderful as the subscription price is fair in my opinion.As for the Blink Doorbell, we have only had it for about a week now and so far, I'd say it's good.  I have found that we prefer to have the motion detection turned off on the camera so we only receive recorded videos when someone rings the doorbell.  We are using our Alexa device as our doorbell sound inside our home, that was somewhat easy to set up.  Found plenty of information online as to how to do that.  Only negative thing i'd say is that it is very difficult to mount the camera itself to the mounting bracket if you do not know ahead of time what to do.  Once the bracket is mounted, you will need to line up the grooves on the back of the camera slightly higher than the ones on the mounting bracket so that you can FIRMLY slide the camera down and lock in into place.  A fair amount of force was required for this.Overall, we are happy so far.", "I have a very love/hate relationship with this system. It\u2019s worth the read if you have an elderly parent/grandparent. Bare with me\u2026..Likes: I love the convenience of the system. They are battery operated so essentially if you have Wi-Fi the cameras work. The picture is great and the battery life isn\u2019t bad even when in \u201calarmed\u201d mode and utilized multiple times a day. This works great for keeping an eye on my grandma and keeping her home as long as possible. It creates a sense of comfort so I can check in on her multiple times a day and make sure she is safe.Dislikes: The cameras can have quite a bit of delay. Sometimes by the time I\u2019m notified of someone in my driveway, they\u2019re already out of their car and standing at the door. I\u2019m hoping the doorbell will help with this.My biggest downside, while I know this won\u2019t be an inconvenience or issue for most it is a huge negative for my family and I and our situation. Let me explain\u2026.My elderly grandma still lives at home. We like to keep an eye on her. So myself, my dad and my aunt all have access to her account.I like the camera system enough that I invested in the system myself for my home. Here lies the issue. I\u2019d like to be able to receive notifications from both locations. In order to do this, I need both on the same account. When I do that, my dad and aunt also have access to see my cameras which I don\u2019t want.  The only other option is to log in and out of each account. My grandmas account is set up under her phone number. Every time I log off I need to \u201cverify\u201d the account with a text code that is sent to her. My grandma is 84 and doesn\u2019t know how to text. The other option is to choose which house I\u2019d like to watch for the day. How do you choose \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI really hope that blink will look into this and create a way where I can possibly keep both accounts logged in, receive notifications from both locations and not have my dad know every time my mom (his ex-wife) comes over to visit.", "UODATE: I ordered the corner mount and that made all the difference in getting my doorbell in place. Blink was very responsive to my concerns and I was able to get someone to assist me with the final mounting, and I am grateful for the added layer of vision this new angle allows. I love my blink system and how easily it works with Alexa!  If you have trouble, reach out to their customer service folks. They will not disappoint!(Original post written in the throes of frustration: The instructions to mount the frame are easy to follow. Attaching the unit to the mounted frame has, thus far, kept me from using the device. Either I\u2019m an idiot or the mounting and securing is too difficult for an elderly woman with a bum shoulder. I want to return it, but I need the security measure. I\u2019d welcome any advice you\u2019ve got.)They read it, reached out and responded with kindness and help! I love Blink!", "After reading professional reviews that said the detection and image qualities were good but not quite as good as Ring and others, I decided to give it a try when I could get this for $35 vs. $100+ for other makers.  I use the Blink system and have 4 cameras outside for security and know they are reliable.  That said the Doorbell is just excellent.  The doorbell is fairly close to the blink module inside the house which may result in improved reliability compared to the reviews I read.  The image quality is exceptional (you can change it from low to high, I have it set on high).  The detection is also incredible, always lets me know when there is someone there at the door.  I have it integrated with Alexa and one of my echo shows and you can view the last activity instantly from the show and see who is there.  I would highly recommend this over other products as it is a lot cheaper and works as advertised.", "I was an early adopter of the Blink camera system. I own several, and have recommended Blink to many, many people. Sadly, this new doorbell missed the mark - the mounting system is a design failure. I attempted to mount and and dismount the camera from the backplate prior to drilling holes in my steel siding. Now, I'm very competent, and confident with DIY projects, however, even after watching the instructional video and reading numerous reviews, I truly struggled with this design. I eventually managed to get the camera mounted to the backplate, but even with the supplied tool, removal was simply too cumbersome. Sadly, I'm returning this even before trying out the actual performance of the product. After all, how am I supposed to eventually change the batteries when it's mounted to the house when I can't easially open it on my kitchen counter? Sorry Blink. Back to the drawing board.", "Overall, it's an ok product.  It took several days to adjust the camera settings and activity zones to avoid getting car traffic alerts.  This did involve dialing back the camera sensitivity which may be the reason for the inconsistent results we are having with motion detection.  There is still a degree of confusion about the motion detection - some say that it detects motion even with the overall system is disarmed (we already have Blink cameras operational).  Others say it only detects motion when the system is armed or someone rings the bell.  The camera does turn on when the bell is rung - that is consistent and the sound quality of the chime and the microphone/speaker is good.  We have two instances of motion detection when the system is off, so I'm guessing the first claim is true, but it is really inconsistent.  Since we have the other cameras (that are very reliable) it's not critical for our purposes (doorbell with camera).  However, it would be nice to know if, perhaps, we have a malfunctioning unit.  We did not experience any difficulties with mounting the unit to the house as some have stated.  It is a snug fit, but the instructions are very clear and it was up in one try.  Syncing to the existing system was simple and literally took about 2 minutes.", "I was nervous to buy this device because of the negative reviews regarding mounting. However I\u2019m glad I bit the bullet and did it. I had a Ring 2 doorbell however without the Ring alarm system and already having Blink cameras to watch my dog, I wanted to consolidate my apps for security. So I got the blink doorbell and I had no issues mounting \u2014 unless I did it incorrectly? The app walked me through all of the instructions in order to get it set up and installed on my house. And because I live in a duplex the wide angle was a nice surprise. It gives me the right view so I can see someone coming up our stairs without invading my neighbor\u2019s privacy. It also gives me a good view of the front door even though it\u2019s not mounted right next to it .I haven\u2019t quite figured out if the connection with Alexa is as seamless as the Ring was. But I think I\u2019m handy enough to make things work.You really can\u2019t beat the price. And now I\u2019m able to give my Ring to someone who just wants to watch their doorstep.Curious to see how long the batteries last. I think it said over a year. For me that\u2019s nice because I hated having to charge the ring battery. Even though I had it hard wired, the cold weather would eventually deplete the battery. I find it much easier to just pop in AA batteries.Overall I think none of these doorbells have it all. You\u2019ve just got to find what works for you. Between my simplsafe alarm system and smart lock and my Blink indoor cameras that are so affordable, and now the added security being able to see my front doorstep, I\u2019m a happy camper.So far the only complaint I have is that I can\u2019t set the doorbell to have motion alerts unless my system is armed. I kind of want to get motion alerts even when I\u2019m home during the day but I don\u2019t necessarily want to arm my system because I have other cameras in the house that I\u2019ll trigger while I\u2019m home. I don\u2019t want to turn off motion announcements on those other cameras because I want to watch my dog while I\u2019m gone.", "Disappointed is an understatement. I\u2019ve had blink products for years and this was the first price of equipment from them that has totally fallen flat. I know it\u2019s a cheap alternative to other security systems but I got it to sync to my other 4 cameras and was completely underwhelmed. First off you can\u2019t set up a scheduled time for the doorbell to come on without purchasing another module on top of the one you own (which I already have for my other cameras). Secondly you have to force the front plate onto the mounted plate almost to the point to where you\u2019re afraid the cheap plastic is going to break but somehow it latches into place. I put all of my weight onto it and was afraid I was going to rip the screws out of the trim. Then once installed the motion detection feature (even after turned on) doesn\u2019t work. Don\u2019t plan on this recording anything unless someone pressed the chime button (which does work). Overall I\u2019m disappointed in blink and probably will be looking to switch to another service once the batteries on my current cameras die again for the umteenth time\u2026.", "I usually wait for a month or so to review a product like this to see how it performs but since it is new and there are few reviews I am submitting this after only a few days.I already had four other Blink cameras installed so this doorbell was added to an existing hub.  I replace a wired doorbell with the Blink doorbell. The physical install is 2 screws for mounting and an additional 2 screws to connect the existing doorbell wires which is optional.  The setup is ridiculously easy on the Blink app.  All together installation was about 15 minutes, most of which was reading the instructions.The picture quality is excellent.  Motion detection is the same as the cameras and night vision on my front porch is excellent.  The existing doorbell dings and dongs like it should and my phone notifies me in second of the doorbell being pushed.  Remarkable for $50 is all I can say.  I will update the review in a month or so. So far, so good.", "UPDATE: okay after speaking to Blink\u2019s technical support they immediately offered help. I love this doorbell camera! I have an echo show and an echo dot in another room and I am able to hear when the doorbell is being rung simply through the Echo devices! It\u2019s super convenient to see who\u2019s at the door on the echo show as well! The picture and sound quality on this doorbell is sooo great. They also let me know they are working on bringing on a chime as well, which is amazing! Thank you blink :)Preordered this device since everyone had something negative to say about the ring but at this point that must\u2019ve been the better option. I won\u2019t be able to know if my doorbell has been rung unless my phone is on loud and on??? Where is the chime? Something to plug into wall to hear it from another room? It\u2019s inconvenient, plus it takes a while from the click of the doorbell to actually get a notification on my phone. Not liking it so far. Other than that, it\u2019s hard to put on the wall but picture quality is good and motion detection works so far.", "I'm not able to put my trust in the doorbell. I know for a fact that even wired the doorbell will go dead in 3 days.I don't know who the genius is on programming and making the doorbell work.  IF THE DOORBELL IS WIRED THRU YOUR OLD BUTTON THE POWER SHOULDN'T BE GOING THRU THE BATTERIES AT ALL. I'm so disappointed about the whole thing. With the sync module has made the doorbell operating for now 1week so I'm just waiting for it to go dead.  Who even came up with how the doorbell operates I don't know. I'm probably going to go back to my Ring doorbell.", "I pre-ordered the blink doorbell as soon as I heard about it and it finally arrived!Ignore the bad reviews! I honestly believe that they are all based on user-error. The setup and installation literally took me less than 10 minutes. I used the wired connection to connect the doorbell to the chime in my home. Instructions were straight forward and clear. Doorbell snapped onto mounting bracket with a little effort, but that\u2019s what I want for security purposes.I tested the motion detection and video and all works great! The only complaint that I have and will change my review to five stars once fixed is the video color. Faces are blown out by the sun and bright light behind the person. I\u2019m expecting that this will be fixed with a firmware update.I am very happy so far and glad to add the doorbell to my blink camera system.", "Overall I like this doorbell.  I would give it five stars except for the long delay before I can view or talk to the person ringing the doorbell.  If I set the video to record clip when doorbell is pressed then I can't talk or view until the clip is finished recording.  If I don't record clip the fastest is saying talk to front on the echos.  The echo show take longer because a prompt \"waiting for blink camera\" comes up for several seconds before I am able to talk.  Ideally, I would like to record a clip when away and talk to person ringing the doorbell immediately.", "All the support videos for mounting the doorbell made it look very easy.FYI- it is NOT that easy. I broke one of the hinges that is supposed to lock onto the doorbell because the instructions say use \u201cmoderate force\u201d.Both my husband and I had to give up trying to get this thing mounted because we were getting so frustrated.I tried again in the morning and FINALLY got it in place but just be weary, it\u2019s definitely NOT as easy as the videos make it look. The video on the blink app shows the woman just casually sliding it into place and that is just totally not accurate.As far as the doorbell itself, it\u2019s a decent little camera and the quality is pretty good.I have an Amazon package getting delivered today so I\u2019m curious to see how the motion detection will work.It got 3 stars because of the mounting difficulty", "The product works well however without the cloud subscription this product is useless.  I emphasize this because disk space is very cheap and for Amazon not to allow the consumer to leverage local storage is being greedy.  You can purchase a 256gb usb stick for 30 bucks which could hold a year or more of video. I am going to try the Eufy product it allows to use your own storage no subscription.  So for this I give this product one star", "Update: I was contacted by a blink support team member who was very helpful.  Not sure what they did but the doorbell now records to the local storage of the sync module without having a blink subscription.Doorbell was easy to install.  The doorbell records video to the cloud just fine but will not record video to the USB storage of the blink sync module 2.  If you don't want cloud storage then don't buy this doorbell because it doesn't record to the sync module as it should.  Tech support first said batteries were no good but when tested both batteries were at the proper 1.5v.  Called tech support again and was told to wait until the free trial of the cloud storage expires to see if it starts recording to the USB (will update review when trial expires).  All other blink cameras installed record to USB but this doorbell will not.", "The camera is good. It installed and set up pretty easily. I added it to my existing Blink system. It is able to notify me using my many Echo devices when someone rings my door bell which is good. I have several Echo Shows and I think it should pop up a live feed (or at least a picture) automatically when someone rings the bell. Instead I get a message that someone is ringing my door bell. Even better since it is 2021 would be to recognize the person and tell me \"Joe Smith is ringing your door bell\"!The picture quality of the camera is pretty good. Unlike the other Blink cameras it's more of a fish eye view to capture the whole area.One thing I thought was a bit strange during the installation. Even though I'm using the power from the door bell wires, I still had to put the batteries in to set up the power part and the part that actually rings the physical door bell.", "Dislike:Most say the mounting is difficult, I find it incredibly easy and even easier to remove. I can pop it on and off easily which means it could get stolen.The camera angle is bad. I used to just use an outdoor camera mounted above my door, which sees everything including faces, where packages are left, etc, and is out of reach from thieves. This doorbell camera doesn\u2019t see the ground in front of the door, you just get waist up and lots of sky. Basically - blind spots everywhere. I\u2019m guessing this is typical of any doorbell camera so less of a knock in blink and just a realization these things are a waste of money without serious mounting modifications.It\u2019s a fairly large doorbell, and if you need a wedge or modification to mount it, it protrudes out a lot.Doesn\u2019t seem very weather resistant. Lots of gaps, doesn\u2019t sit flush or tight. Not a problem for me since I have a large covering but for some this could pose an issue.Like:You can connect it to your doorbell, which worked out well enough.Easy to set up and mount, took all of 15 min.Price\u2026 for just the doorbell it\u2019s less than half most other options, so I won\u2019t feel too bad when it aggravates me enough that I ditch it.Summary I\u2019ll use it for a while and see how it goes but a security camera above the door plus a regular doorbell is a much better set up.", "Works great BUT the only 2 gripe I have1: Is the \"limit the Field of view\" doesn't work to help you limit what the camera picks up when you have the \"Motion camera\" Enabled, I know that is a BETA feature but I have used it on the stand alone camera's for a VERY long time and would be nice to have working. With out this feature working the camera picks up vehicles going up and down the road or even Horses across the road about 60' away and will really eat up the Batteries quickly.2: To have a real inside doorbell sound inside without having a wired Doorbell you need to buy the \"CHIME\" I think or have your phones volume turned up and with you but if your not home and others are they just hear the Alexa say your message, My Alexa merely tells me someone is at the front door and doesn't really ring.B Mills", "I\u2019ve been waiting at least 4 years for this Blink doorbell product.  I initially installed Blink cameras around my home, but had to add a Ring doorbell for the front door entry area.  I don\u2019t know why it took Blink so long to develop the doorbell.Anyways, it\u2019s finally here and it works fine!  I no longer have to rely on a two-vendor solution. ( It was a hassle having to maintain a Blink and Ring solution.)The doorbell integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Blink products.  It was very easy to add and install.  As others have mentioned, the only challenge was slipping back on the top cover (needs to be pressed on and slid down).The video quality is great and the ring is loud.  I have no complaints.  It\u2019s no different from the rest of my Blink cameras, and can be just as easily monitored on my iPhone and computers.", "I have multiple blink cameras so I decided to get the doorbell when it came out. I had gotten my daughter a Ring camera and it was fairly easy to install. Right out of the box you can see how cheaply made the camera is. Includes nothing to assist with the install. Ring came with everything you needed from the blocks to the drill bit to install in brick. Any accessories you need must be ordered separately. It did come with screws to use in wood. Also if you thing you are doing away with batteries by hard wiring it, wrong!!! The wiring only powers the bell not the camera. Ring come with 2 rechargeable batteries so you can swap them out. I pre ordered the Blink in October, got it in November didn't really look at it till now...so out of my return window. Plus they already lowered the price 15.00 dollars from what I paid.", "My doorbell is set into an alcove in my home and the old button doorbell was flush mounted to a side wall, so a 45 degree mount is the only option for my home. I had a Ring doorbell (720 dpi) and it was time to upgrade it to the newer Blink system of cameras that I already have inside my home. I waited for the new Blink doorbell that just released (shipped 11/01/21) with the higher video resolution, but had to do mod on the old Ring mount so as to make it face the correct way out. I created a faceplate out of an old clear plexiglass scrap I had laying around. Marked where holes were on the old Ring doorbell were located on the Plex which was easy since it was clear anyways. Cut, drilled and mounted it to the old 45 degree Ring base. It's not half bad and a fresh coat of house paint over the mount and new faceplate will serve it well. It took awhile to figure out the most optimal way to set the setting in the phone app... but with a little trial and error I figured it out. Put all your Blink cameras on the same category as your Blink Sync Module 2. Arm the entire system then click on the little runner icon above each camera to turn off your interior cameras so as not to get false alarms as you walk around in your own home. This way only your outdoor cameras are armed during your awake hours.", "First time user for video doorbells with zero experience with home security systems. This was very easy to install and set up. Great quality of video and pictures. Only issue I had was that I wasn't getting notifications from the app and support wasn't helpful, kept trying to get me to return the device even tho I kept telling them that the bell/camera works fine, it was the app that wasn't sending push notifications. Eventually I figured out to just clear out the cache from the app and that did the trick. I did not get a Sync as this is the only Blink device I have but I may invest in another Blink camera with Sync for my back entrance/porch area. I'm still in the trial period for the subscription service and I'll probably subscribe once that's over since it's so cheap ($30/yr for Basic). IMO this is a great intro to video doorbells and basic home security, especially for the price point.", "Finally Blink produced a doorbell. When I got the notification I went ahead and pre-ordered. If you invested into the cameras already the doorbell is a no brainer. Once you scan the qr code everything syncs to your account. Name the camera, pick its location.... smooth setup. It can either be battery powered or hard wired to an existing doorbell. We preferred the battery option so we'd get the optimal placement for it. This being our first video doorbell I have nothing to compare it to. Honestly never thought of purchasing one until this was offered. We have no issues. Only thing I'd ask is would it be possible in a update to add a few new chimes. Our previous battery powered doorbell and receiver speaker's bells were more harmonious vs blink's sounding winey. Maybe it's in the settings... If so I'll update this post.", "I pre-ordered this and didn't get the wedge to help angle the product which would have been very helpful. The only thing I wish it had was a live view.Update. I've had this for a month and find it to be nearly worthless. It takes too long to realize that it's seen something. By the time it notifies me and I look at what it's recorded nothing is there. I have gig internet so it's not that. I will have a delivery driver park in front of my house, walk up my driveway and drop the package in front of the door, walk down the driveway and leave and it doesn't start recording until the vehicle is gone. Then it says you have a live view but the action is gone. Plus I really wanted something that I could drop in on and see live because I wanted to not just because of a package.

I also have no photos of any delivery person dropping anything off on my porch - and I have received packages.  I will continue to experiment with the sensitivity, but I'm not hopeful.  Also, when I go to take a photo of the front porch from my phone, more times than not, I get the message, \"Thumbnail failed.\"  The live camera works adequately but the background sounds like an airport.

It may not be or have the high-quality video and advanced features as some of the other competitors in the market but it does the job well.  Plus, I decided to get the blink doorbell since my home has many blink cameras (indoor and outdoor).  The price seems right but it did not include a corner or wedge mount -- that will cost you an additional 13 dollars or 8 if you get it on sale. Given that the corner or wedge are essential parts for doorbells that are to the side of the door, I thought this was an oversight by blink to include it since for pennies for the dollar they could have included these parts.

The night video is ok (grainy but it works).", "I agree with the other reviewers who struggled with the mount.  The camera and microphone work great and it was very easy to connect it to my existing Blink account and sync module--works well on my phone and my Alexa Show. The ONLY problem is the mount---I watched the video, followed the directions and tried my best to get it to work with my vinyl siding--no problem connecting the back piece to the siding but I couldn't get the camera/doorbell part to connect to the backpiece.  The only way I could finally use it was to connect the back piece to the unit before mounting, and then use heavy duty double sided mounting tape to connect it to my outer glass door frame.

I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me. With my Samsung connected to my computer, I'm able to watch my blind spots without touching my phone. I wanted to close with how impressed I am with the quality of the recording. Very confident that with these cams and my blink system, any unlawful actions will be caught on cam which will be key to pressing charges. If you are on the fence, don't be. This is security at a very very reasonable price point :)Update: 10-11-21Pro...err n00b tip since I'm also learning :)The software will record 24/7 as long as you have Smart Scene set up. I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

The packaging is good an it comes with everything you need to get started. It is nice that a mount is included. I mounted the unit on rails on my second story balcony overlooking my front yard.

It is nice that at night when a street light is on the camera stays in color. When it flips to the IR black and white mode the image quality is still good.

I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me. With my Samsung connected to my computer, I'm able to watch my blind spots without touching my phone. I wanted to close with how impressed I am with the quality of the recording.

I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

It is nice that at night when a street light is on the camera stays in color. When it flips to the IR black and white mode the image quality is still good. The amazing feature of this camera is the human detection and auto tracking. I get a push notification through the mobile app almost instantly when a person is seen by the camera. I haven\u2019t really gotten any false alerts from it so far which is nice. The camera was a little bit tricky to get connected to my WiFi at first but it was because I was a little bit beyond the recommended 15 ft max distance from the WiFi router during initial installation. Once you bring the camera working the recommended 15 ft radius it was pretty easy to get it added to the mobile app. The app is pretty easy to use and has all the features you would want. Overall I think this camera is a great value for the price and would recommend it, especially for home surveillance because it had the built in WiFi and you only need to supply power to the camera.", "I have recently had to deal with neighbors who were trying to strong arm me. I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me. With my Samsung connected to my computer, I'm able to watch my blind spots without touching my phone. I wanted to close with how impressed I am with the quality of the recording.

This is security at a very very reasonable price point :)Update: 10-11-21Pro...err n00b tip since I'm also learning :)The software will record 24/7 as long as you have Smart Scene set up. I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me.

I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me.

This is security at a very very reasonable price point :)Update: 10-11-21Pro...err n00b tip since I'm also learning :)The software will record 24/7 as long as you have Smart Scene set up. I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

I have mine set to \"Tap Perform to start...\" and then the action is \"Record Video\". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic.

This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the \"Pop-out picture in picture\" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat!

No possible way to use this device!", "This a must have product from Imou! I already have the Bullet 2MP and the Cue 1080p camera for a year already, but I needed one that includes Pan mode, and I like the easy Pan & Tilt feature on this one, beautiful night vision color mode and the smart tracking feature. Also for nightvision mode, you can choose wether on motion detection, turn spotlights on and get full color video or just IR recording. It has two spotlights which is very bright. I like how the camera goes in the moving object and record instantly. The Cruiser model is a must have into your shop or home outdoors.", "So far so goodCamera was pretty easy to get connected to WiFiDoes a good job letting me know if there\u2019s movementWould like motion tracking to be a little betterWould recommend this cameraHopefully I can say the same a year from nowI have went thru 3 other cameras so far.... they didn\u2019t work well after some time", "I can\u2019t say enough great things.

Zero issues", "I received this camera and waited to have someone install it for me because of my age and disability. When they unboxed it, the power cord was damaged and could not even be plugged into the camera!

Total waste of money!", "My 3 cameras were kept disconnected from the Wi-Fi almost every 3 weeks even though it's only 6 feets away from the router, i have the powerful router that can reach 50 ft away.

The qualities were good but not reliable.Update 12/3/21I contacted the support from china regarding the problem that i had faced, the only thing that they suggested to change the IP address on every single camera without the further instructions how to do that. I sent the email asking about how and until now there's no replied from them, now I am stuck with this camera that kept disconnected from the WIFI every week.", "The camera is cute. I like it so much. And it is very easy to connect the router. I just followed the instructions in the Mobile APP, without the user manual. It has pretty nice picture quality. I can see everything clearly outside of my door. The pan and tilt are awesome function. I can control the camera from the APP to watch around. It is really cool.", "2 thing I dislike this camera because the 2ways talk and siren function not working cause every time I clicked in microphone it will bug me out and make the camera go offline.", "Great product, beats those expensive PTZ camera by a landslide.Worth every penny!", "WIFI won't work ( cannot pair camera and router even if they are in the same room).

The purpose was to not only be able to move the camera around the back yard but also have human detection capabilities. Set up was a breeze and the mounting style actually works well. Four screws and you\u2019re done. It requires an outlet for power, so keep that in mind when installing it.  Downloading the app and setting up the camera was smooth. Camera image and video is crystal clear.  The white led lights are very bright and work great at night. The infrared lights work well too.  WiFi connectivity works even better. The two large antennas allow it to lock on to the signal nicely. Overall, I\u2019m very impressed with this camera. Solid build and great image quality.", "The quality of this camera is outstanding.  It has excellent day time viewing and honestly has the best night vision i have seen yet of any wired or wireless camera.  Two way audio is very good overall, very little lag time and very distinct.  I like this brand over any brand yet I have installed or owned but I could not give it a 5 star rating.  I've had issues with connectivity of this wireless camera at even short range.  Also, the ptz function is not very responsive,  either it works or it just doesn't work at all.  For the price and picture quality this camera is the best option yet for wireless camera systems.", "For less than 100 bucks you can't beat this ptz. Very few have full color video at night, let alone clear and crisp color video. The motion tracking works well and having a home position to to return to is great. You can save multiple favorites and quickly pan to them. Wifi connection has been stable and the external antennas actually work unlike some that are for looks. The only issue I had with it was the flashing spotlight which was quickly fixed. Customer service is quick to respond. I would definitely recommend this ptz.", "There is a lot to like about this camera. Amazing clarity. Great range of motion. But no matter how I set the sensitivity or to only report human movement, I get 6 or 7 false alarms and have to shut it up. Luckily there are no neighbors nearby, because the alarm would wake them. It just seems to register intruders when bugs and moths fly by.

It is very soft, the color is beautiful, its big enough to cover me from head to toe, I'm 5'1\", and for the price i can deal with the fuzzies.

Disappointing", "Purchased these as a bedside light solution in my Airbnb, when my original, over-the-center, above-the-headboard lights that didn\u2019t work due to a window being located exactly where I needed to install the original light.  Since I had an offset window on one side, and very limited space on either side of the bed, traditional end table lights weren\u2019t really an option.  I prefer to have everything firmly attached, so there is less chance of breakage, so these cords, coupled with the customized brackets were the perfect option.  The color was a perfect fit, and they are modern, yet retro.  I think they are designed to be installed in the ceiling, because the switch mechanism is located very close to the actual plug, and for my installation, I had to creatively attach the switch to the leg of the end table, so it wasn\u2019t on the floor.  I think I\u2019m going to purchase the yellow ones for my other Airbnb.", "Like other reviewers have mentioned the on/off switch is far too close to the plug. I have used a smart plug to remedy this. So I apprise you to consider this as an added expense before your purchase it. I don\u2019t have the patience to stoop every time I\u2019d like some light!Otherwise, the color I purchased was the teal, is a brilliant color. The collar is nice and satiny gold. The sticker was a bit difficult to get off, but I used Goof Off solvent to remove the remaining tackiness.Overall a great solution for a tight spot that needs some light.", "Beautiful lamp cord that\u2019s has a high quality look and feel to it. Color was perfect for my paper octopus lamp that I put together. Cord was a good length and had no issues reaching an eight foot ceiling. My outlet was close by as well. There is a plastic switch to turn it on and off. I have it connected to a wifi enabled smart plug to make it even easier to turn on remotely or via Alexa.", "These lights are fabulous. I had an old, totally unsafe sconce near my bed that needed to be taken out (that explains the huge patched area in progress in my pic). Anyway, I wanted two lights on either side for reading and didn\u2019t want to actually wire for them. These were super affordable, simple and gorgeous. I love that I can move them around at will or switch the look with different decorative bulbs. The sleek look is a great pop of fun in this old historic house. My only issue is really minor. I don\u2019t love how close the switch is to the actual plug. Wish there was more slack. You have to have a plug very nearby or you\u2019ll need an extension cord. Otherwise, you can\u2019t reach the switch.Overall though, fabulous buy. I\u2019ll probably order the teal color for another room.", "These are just described and look great with large frosted light bulb in my bed room. I took off a star however because the cord is a little kinky and does not hang nicely. I had hoped it would stretch out after hanging for a while but it has been a few weeks and no change. I might try to iron them on low because I think it really cheapens the look.", "Terrible quality. Review is for \"grey\"(concrete). First the socket boke because it is made out of tin foil. I hard wired these pendants in and used custom wire routing that I was not going to do again so I repaired the socket with solder and a lot of patience and skill instead of exchanging it. After my repair I was very lightly screwing the bulb in and the bulb snapped in two. I was already unhappy with the product because of the cheap quality odd shaped (not round) wire that is not flexible and impossible to get kinks out for good looks. The \"concrete\" looks manufactured instead of what you would expect natural concrete to look like. Overall just a very cheaply made product that I should have just spent the time to make these myself.", "This is a really well planned swag, especially for the price. The plug is flat on the outlet and takes up little real estate. The cord is a decent height off the ground. The head is metal and the teal looks nice.

I bought it to use as a plug in, but it comes with hardware to hardwire it in. The cord is generously long, although one complaint I have is that the switch is a bit close to the plug. If you're plugging it in behind a bed, then it might be difficult to access the switch. The concrete it's made of is nice and heavy, and sturdy too. I dropped it once and it didn't get a ding on it. The light the included bulb emmits is a gorgeous warm light. It makes it look like there's a sunset in my room whenever it's on. I normally don't like warm hugs with lighting, but this one is lovely!Apso, the bulb gets a bit hot, but it's nothing that will actually cause a burn.", "I purchased 2 of these for my zoom lighting setup, I added a couple smart bulbs and it works great.

I misread the description and didn\u2019t realize the LED lighting is integrated into the housing (I bought an unneeded separate grow bulb). The cord seems well-made and is attractive and has ample length. The only CON: This light seems too heavy for the included ceiling mount. I didn\u2019t trust it to hold (who wants a $200 light to crash to the floor?!) so I purchased a \u201cflange\u201d type mounting hook where you drill a small hole in your ceiling and push the wings up above the ceiling for a more secure hold.", "I can\u2019t believe that I spent this much for lights, but my plants are so happy I did.  I was looking for attractive plant lights.  You would think that would be easy to find with all the people who like to decorate with plants, but attractive AND beneficial doesn\u2019t seem to be a thing.  These are both.  They look like they are well made and the light they put out is spurring growth like crazy.  Would definitely recommend, but the hooks that are included are cheap so you may want to buy better quality for these lights.  I bought two hooks for each fixture, one hook for over the plants and the other hook closer to the outlet so the full weight of the lamp is not suspended over just one hook.  I thought that the cord would not wear out as quickly that way, as the power cord also serves as the hanger.  Worth the money.", "My lime tree was not wintering well in my northern climate. Over 15 years ago I purchased a florescent grow light that was just so so. I decided to see if technology had advanced to LED grow lights for citrus trees.  After researching various options I decided to try  the Aspect 40W Luxury LED Grow Light.  After only 72 hours I am already seeing incredible results. My lime tree is bursting with new growth...simply AMAZING!!!  As a bonus our chocolate lab has a new favorite place to rest.  This product is well worth the cost.", "I had my doubts. I looked high and low for the sort of lighting set up that would be good for my plants but also be an appealing light to have in my room - so easy on the eyes. The light itself is warm, more yellow than white which is very nice to look at. The build quality of the light itself is awesome, very sturdy design, the light hardly gets hot - the driver on the other hand does get quite warm. Timer is quite basic and is a nice addition. Something that I thought was great and not mentioned enough was the corded cable (almost feels like a climbing rope) looks very nice. All together very high quality. See the photos for a comparison of the lighting (high and low exposure). I am considering a second for the other corner. This light also has a focused beam and is quite nested so you can look at it without being blinded! I'm hoping the performance for growing matches all of the pros I list here. Will update in a couple months to talk about plant health/growth. Checking all the boxes! These lights will be with me for years to come. Price is the hardest part about the aspect but I'd say they have something special with this one so it is worth it for a plant lover like me. I considered giving 4 starts fro the price but tehre is really noting like it out there at the moment. To put it into perspective - I spent 70$ (all amazon purchases) for the items on the left.

My only complaint is that it doesn't have more mounting options-- I'd love if it had a pivoting ceiling mount.", "I had been looking for something like this grow light for a while, so I was thrilled when I came across it on Amazon.  It looks great, and works even better.  It's nice this company realizes that most of us keep our houseplants in our living rooms and family rooms and want something that not only works well, but looks great too!  Everything I've seen prior to this has been too industrial looking, and certainly not designed to look good in our homes.  Not only does it look great, my plants seem to love it.  The first one I received wasn't working, and they responded quickly to my email (on a Monday holiday when everything was closed), and sent a brand new one within days.  The replacement works great, and I am planning on getting at least another two for other areas of my house.  The included timer is a nice bonus as once it's set up, you really don't even have to think about it any more.  The light is well made, looks great, offers great convenience, and the plants really do well with it.", "I can count the number of reviews I've posted online on one hand, but man does this light deliver.  My home has zero good options for growing plants indoors.  All of my large windows face north and are under a porch roof and a large maple tree, so the amount of sunlight is almost zero.I recently picked up bonsai again as a hobby and I knew I needed to supplement the light available to my tree (portulacaria afra).  I bought the large Aspect pendant in black to hang about 2 feet above my tree, and my goodness the tree is thriving.  The amount of dense and deep green new growth in the first few weeks under this light is incredible.  It's a nice warm light, it looks good, and it's perfect for growing my tree and a few neighboring succulents on my desk away from all windows.I have tried some of the other cheap 'gooseneck' grow lights available on Amazon, and while they might have worked (sort of), they look terrible and cast an awful purple light.  This light and this company solve all of those problems.  They also sell a bulb for standard lamps and a track lighting system.  I fully anticipate I will be buying more from Soltech in the future.I can't recommend this highly enough.", "Bought this for the office to supplement the dim light coming in a north facing window, especially for winter. I am so darn happy with it!!!! It comes with all the hanging hardware and cord management snaps as well as a timer for the outlet! You don\u2019t need to buy any additional accessories, this lamp comes as a whole complete kit. It\u2019s elegant looking, amazingly bright but pleasant, and works wonderfully. I\u2019m so happy to have some extra light and the extra plants in my office where I have to exist 40 hours a week. I am completely thrilled with this lamp! Oh! And it came with a wonderfully informative booklet on how low to hang the light with a couple pages of common houseplants and their light needs. It\u2019s fantastic! And made in the USA if that\u2019s local for you! :)", "Does the job!I made the mistake of buying a cheap grow light for some smaller plants in my home, only to find two weeks later that my plants leaves were weakening. In order to not repeat this mistake, I decided to try out something more on the higher end in terms of pricing for some of my larger plants.It's only been a few weeks since I've installed this grow light and I'm already seeing noticeable growth in my plants! My monstera has perked up and is getting ready to push out a new leaf. The hosta I was rehabbing has accelerated in growth and my philodendron has pushed out several new leaves already.The light is definitely strong and emits very little heat. I have it 2 feet above the top of my monstera and it's pushing out around 1900 FC at that distance. Around 4.5 ft from the light, it's still pushing out ~500 FC directly under the light. (FC drops to around ~200-300 if you move a foot outwards.)If you can afford it I would definitely recommend this light.I only wish this light was offered in a more conical design to allow the light to spread further around it.", "I have to admit, when I first saw this product the price kind of threw me off. $150 for a light bulb seems like way too much. However, when the product arrived I could see why they were charging this much. It is because you're buying quality here. It is beautifully designed!I bought this for my poor meyer lemon tree. It has been struggling for many months now and I hope that this light will help it come back to life. I once bought a red and blue LED but I couldn't stand looking at the awful pink color that it created.Hopefully this light, a new fertilizer, and some better draining soil will bring this meyer back to life. I'll keep you guys posted!", "Very bright LED light and looks stylish.  Disregard the light cord pulled to the left it is actually long enough to hang straight down and still plug in to the outlet.  Make sure you leave no less than a quarter inch between the ceiling and the screw button so you can screw on the cap and have the cord taunt.  It\u2019s made in America which I love but it would be nice if it were a little cheaper in cost.  I would still purchase and recommend this product.", "I bought this in early spring shortly after acquiring a small calamari citrus tree. We get a lot of light in the summer, but not so much in winter and it started dropping leaves and buds so I didn\u2019t want the plant to suffer during months of low light. Ever since hanging the light above the plant at full-sun height & scheduling about 17hrs of light its shown significant growth, and is now blooming again. The timer is not the easiest to use but once set it works. The only note of caution is if it gets bumped the \u201cteeth\u201d can be pushed in and it will mess up your lighting schedule. I eventually put the power strip & timer in a storage box, which keeps it tidier & protected from any accidental bumps.", "I really like this light, I have not had it long but it has a nice glow to it for a cozy room and seems to provide ample light for my plants. Zone 5 winters can be rough on my tropical plants so I am waiting to see if the light truly helps, but setup was easy (some people complained about the mounting, it took me and one other person about 20 minutes max) and like I said it is sleek and appealing. Bit pricey but I didn't want cheap junk that would break anyway (as I have spent more than what this light costs replacing cheap, inefficient and ugly grow lamps)", "Couldn\u2019t be happier with the light.  It is a stylish light, got light 1st then bought my long leaf Ficus and did not lose any leaves after plant arrived even when prior plant reviews would state they lost leaves.  New growth on plant, timer works wonderful.  Now I can have plants in areas they would otherwise not flourish. Warm fuzzies :). Well packaged, arrived on time.  Worth it because it looks so great and well made, quality product.", "I bought the large version for my key lime tree for the winter. I previously tried to bring it inside in early October and even with bright sunlight through a sliding glass door the leaves began turning yellow within a couple days.  The product arrives carefully packaged and with mounting hardware. It is easy to install with an electric drill. I set it up for a 16 hour light cycle. The most complicated part is setting the timer, but with careful review of the instructions I was able to figure it out. After 10 days, my lime tree has truly thrived with lots of buds and several blooming flowers. It is doing better under the light than it did outside. I will definitely order more products from this company as my plant collection grows.", "Oh my goodness, these lights are amazing. My home office provides excellent indirect light but not enough to support the kind of plants that I have around the room. The sophisticated design of the room required lighting that was beautiful as well as functional. These lights absolutely met the criteria. I ordered the first light as a 'test' to ensure that it lived up to the seller's hype. It did, so I ordered 2-more. (The lights even come with a timer for completely fuss free use.) I love them and highly recommend them for anyone looking for both beauty and function.", "I\u2019m so pleased! These are the best grow lights. My plants are happy, and I\u2019m thrilled at how beautiful my house looks with these. The light is pleasing, warm, and bright (not blinding since it focuses so well onto your plant).", "It\u2019s more expensive than other grow lights but well worth the money! I bought this for my potted orange tree. The design is modern and beautiful. It fits great in my living room and looks like it\u2019s part of the decor. The bulb is truly a full spectrum sun light (I checked with a light meter) yet it\u2019s a warm light and not overwhelmingly bright or hot.  It\u2019s made with high quality materials. You can tell the manufacturer takes pride in their product. I hope to see more products from them in the future!", "My lemon tree LOVES this light. I surprised myself by spending $200 on a grow light, but I wanted to keep my lemon tree happy. I\u2019ve bought two grow lights from different companies in the past ($30 and $40 respectively) and they don\u2019t compare at all in value to this light. Packaging comes with a very helpful little plant book and a timer for the light. I might buy one of the smaller sizes for some of my other finnicky plants. Definitely worth it.", "Moved to a new house with less light indoors. My plants were dying off within the first month. I got all the plants under and around this light and instantly NEW GROWTH. (Well within the next month there was new growth) lol", "Great indoor grow lights. They look very nice inside. I have two of them hanging over a collection of plants that aren't near natural light and all the plants are thriving with the grow lights.", "Finally, grow lights that actually you don't mind looking at in your home! These fit right in and actually elevate the look of our home. The quality is high and I appreciate that they are made in the USA. Light quality also very nice as well as build construction. Good stuff!", "While pricey, my lemon tree is super happy wintering under this lamp. Very powerful, so make sure you follow placement height. Great for my east faving windows over winter. Will likely buy another. Great warm light. Not bright white.", "I love the design of this grow light. Haven\u2019t had them long enough to determine how well they work as far as helping my plants to grow. I do like how they look, though. They were also  very easy to hang.", "If you want a grow light that looks nice and casts beautiful, warm, natural light this the one. The unit itself is unobtrusive and it is super easy to hang (took me 15 minutes to unbox and install). It definitely seems worth it for the price and I already ordered another with plans for a couple more.", "Very strong light, worth the money.  32\" away i get 364 fc, at 12\" away, i get 2700 fc, at 6\" away i get 9000 fc", "Absolutely love this light. No only is it elegant looking but my Ficus has been doing so well under it.I\u2019m definitely looking to buy more.", "These are great lights bought one to check it out and to compare to other grow lights I have been trying out.  I definitely prefer this to the other purchases and went ahead and bought another one. :)Update: still love them and have bought 2 more.", "This is a great buy especially for someone with alot of plants such as myself. I have already referred this product to my plant followers on my plant channel Charlottes Foliage and my social media sites. I will buy more soon,.", "definitely trendy, functional, good looking classic light to keep the lemon tree happy this winter. helps me feel like i\u2019m getting vitamin D too, as the light is bright and sunny on a dark wintry day.", "It is pretty pricey, but absolutely worth it. I hope they come out with different versions in the future.", "Such easy installation and superb lighting for my plants!", "Works great and time very helpful. It was easy to install and hang.  Looks nice in my kitchen.", "Great for indoor plants especially during winter.", "At first I was a little concerned about buying a refurbished product, but now I'm glad I did! It arrived earlier than expected and in spotless working condition! Great Buy!", "Great product, was pleasantly surprised of the quality its worth the cost. It stays cool all day my plants have been loving it!", "has a handmade touch, and booklet has good instructions/info!", "Amazing@!!

I ordered the seeds and greens lights thinking they\u2019d be nice and bright like my regular fluorescent seed starter grow lights and these are junk.

So I contacted GE, who sent me a compatibility chart. Luckily I had another fixture, one that was marked as compatible. Put the bulbs in and they worked\u2026 for about 5 minutes. Then they started flickering. Then I smelled \u201cburnt electronic smell\u201d and that was it. It shut off and now my fixture doesn\u2019t work at all.
