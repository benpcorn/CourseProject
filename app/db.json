It\u2019s difficult to stay connected.1) Builds are fine but require digits instructions.You can go the LEGO website and run with the instruction on you PC or iPad.  Making building a longer task, because as everyone with a device know, the device goes to sleep after a few mins of not touching the screen or mouse.  Which you will do quite often as you look for parts and build.  Go back to screen and - wait have to open up off of the blank PC or iPad.2). APP to Hub through WiFi Bluetooth connections are a pain.  Let\u2019s say you build the bot.  Took some time and annoyance but you build it.  Now you have to connect to Hub to your iPad.  Like many the iPad is connected to your wifi and maybe headphone and probably more...  The Lego builder APP disconnects from the Hub frequently.  Every time you launch the APP you have to make sure the HUB is re-connected.3) Price is a little too high for this.  I know these are small things but I don\u2019t think for this price point LEGO should have skimped on paper instructions as well as not include a launch pad as they had previously.  I understand that the device the person will use is alway different and can be finicky on the connections, but for this price you can include a USB cable of some type.YouTube videos and other reviews are usually paid promotions and don\u2019t include what a regular Dad might say about the product.  Probably gonna be a return as the lag issue with the Hub is a big let down.", "The app is glitchy and was rushed to market for the holiday season. The device compatibility list is small with only the latest and higher end devices being compatible. If your kid is using your old Iphone or Android device, or is on their school Chromebook, don't expect them to be able to use the app and connect to the LEGO hub.", "After reading some reviews on this set I was hesitant to purchase it. I owned the EV3 set once upon a time and everyone was acting like this is a downgrade from that one. Well after watching some comparison videos I decided to go for it and now I\u2019m glad I did.While there are slight differences between this one and the EV3, I think this one is better. All I\u2019ve noticed are improvements, especially considering how much smaller the intelligent brick and motors are. I also love how it has Bluetooth and it can be programmed on my computer or phone.Right out of the box I was able to build a robot that can solve a Rubik\u2019s cube, thanks to instructions on the internet. I\u2019m super excited to build more robots with this set. So far it has been a blast!", "I can not recommend this unit. It is nowhere near the quality and construction of previous Lego attempts of educational robots  Yet another expensive venture after they failed (yes, I bought them both) cars. I think I am all through with Lego products.", "So far it looks really cool. But before you buy it, check the compatibility devices. My daughter got an Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet for Christmas and we thought it would work for this too, then upon checking it was not compatible. We will have to use another device which is just slightly annoying.", "The Mindstorm App is listed on the Kindle App store but it shows unavailable so I am assuming they are working on development. Now we need to figure out a different device for our child to use. The set itself seems great, but device compatibility is a huge part of the customer experience.", "This is what my 8 year old grandson wanted for his birthday.  He still can't stop talking about it.  He loves it!!", "Hard to navigate help. User interface should be more intuitive. No useful printed documentation in the retail box. Bluetooth connection is hit or miss but that may be due to phone's or tablet's version of the operating system/Bluetooth module. Sensor and motor cords are not removable from the respective modules so when they break (and they will break when used by excited, impatient, competitive kids) the cost of replacement is the cost of the sensor or motor - previously, the EV3 cables were removable and less expensive to replace.", "I hate putting a price on education, but that's the world we live in currently. That being said, I did feel like I got a ton of parts in this set, which is a rare feeling with Legos for me.This is a great intro into robotics young and old. Lots of unique pieces, precise motors and lots of room to customize, as you should expect with Legos.If I had to say anything bad about this, outside its price, I feel like the hub only being 6 ports is lame. Pop a Raz Pi into these boxes or an Arduino Mega for a fraction of the price. Curious if anyone sells break out connectors for all these sensors and motors.6 ports is enough for learning though, I'll give them that.If the set was cheaper I would like to get 2 of these and have a build off competition to teach coding in a fun way.", "This MINDSTORM Robot kit really brings the fun of building a LEGO kit together with learning basic programming structure. After building one of the designs, my daughter will then go through the process of programming it.
