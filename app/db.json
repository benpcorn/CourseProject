Let\u2019s say you build the bot.  Took some time and annoyance but you build it.  Now you have to connect to Hub to your iPad.  Like many the iPad is connected to your wifi and maybe headphone and probably more...  The Lego builder APP disconnects from the Hub frequently.  Every time you launch the APP you have to make sure the HUB is re-connected.3) Price is a little too high for this.  I know these are small things but I don\u2019t think for this price point LEGO should have skimped on paper instructions as well as not include a launch pad as they had previously.  I understand that the device the person will use is alway different and can be finicky on the connections, but for this price you can include a USB cable of some type.YouTube videos and other reviews are usually paid promotions and don\u2019t include what a regular Dad might say about the product.

With the pandemic, we have more time at hand, so I took the risk.  I am very happy with it after the first day and will report our experience here: 1) It is fairly easy to get started. My 12 year old boy assembled and programmed the first robot completely by himself, including finding the app and instruction. Having said that, he had some experience with scratch before though was never an avid lego player. 2) It is fun for a child.  I was worried that the assembly would take too long but within 2 hours from opening the box, the robot was functioning and can be \u201cplayed.\u201d 3) The programming and debugging processing is educational. There are many extensions and experiments one can do. 4) the parts are pretty sturdy. In experiments, I saw the robot vehicle bump into the obstacles quite a few times without falling apart.Now, there are a few limitations that I consider to be minor: 1) this is only a STEM toy, therefore the vision sensor for example is not perfect and doe not have good peripheral vision; 2) I am sure there are instructions somewhere, but we have not found instructions on how to use python instead of scratch and had to google to understand the difference between download and streaming mode, etc. but this is just after the first day with the kid poking around with by himself.", "Liked the product = what you see is what you get !", "If your child is interested in building robotic models and learning programming, this set is one of the best options on the market right now.Excellent toy to build programming knowledge and use it for real life applications.

With the pandemic, we have more time at hand, so I took the risk.  I am very happy with it after the first day and will report our experience here: 1) It is fairly easy to get started. My 12 year old boy assembled and programmed the first robot completely by himself, including finding the app and instruction. Having said that, he had some experience with scratch before though was never an avid lego player. 2) It is fun for a child.  I was worried that the assembly would take too long but within 2 hours from opening the box, the robot was functioning and can be \u201cplayed.\u201d 3) The programming and debugging processing is educational. There are many extensions and experiments one can do. 4) the parts are pretty sturdy. In experiments, I saw the robot vehicle bump into the obstacles quite a few times without falling apart.Now, there are a few limitations that I consider to be minor: 1) this is only a STEM toy, therefore the vision sensor for example is not perfect and doe not have good peripheral vision; 2) I am sure there are instructions somewhere, but we have not found instructions on how to use python instead of scratch and had to google to understand the difference between download and streaming mode, etc. but this is just after the first day with the kid poking around with by himself.", "Liked the product = what you see is what you get !", "If your child is interested in building robotic models and learning programming, this set is one of the best options on the market right now.Excellent toy to build programming knowledge and use it for real life applications.

So, after doing research, we decided to purchase this set for his 12th birthday.

The bottom is waterproof so we can sit on dewy grass and not seem like we\u2019ve peed ourselves. Countless drinks and snacks have been spilled on the top and it\u2019s been incredibly easy to wash with no stains. Not to mention how cute it is and how well it goes with my vintage picnic basket.

We then ate Mexican food on it.When it's on slightly wet, tall grass as pictured, the wetness doesn't go through and the grass underneath makes the blanket very comfy.The crinkly sounds others complained about are not annoying. You probably don't move much on the blanket, anyway.Spot cleaning the blanket is not hard.Also, I've been able to refold the blanket perfectly and easily each time, so I don't understand those complaints too much.", "This blanket is comfortable and big enough for two adult + a dog for a sit down picnic. I am happy with the price! I can see it might be difficult to put the handle back because they were trying to make it look fancy with a leather handle. A nylon one (the one used for yoga mat) would have been easier. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. I have use it couple times now and everytime I was able to wrap it back!

It will roll up and easily go back into its cute carrier.I picked this one out of all the options because it comes in nice, understated patterns.

I bought it to set up a picnic for my boyfriend, and it was perfect! It has  a Really beautiful pattern and neutral colors for any occasion.

The tie included to close and carry the blanket is also really difficult to use and is a big hassle. I think something with a velcro strap would have been better, rather than a faux leather strap. It's like trying to close your belt after you've had all you can eat.", "I really like this, the only problem I have with it is how difficult it is to fold back up into the cute original carrying package.", "This has become a must have! I have put it in the wash and air dried it many times, I keep it in my car all the time, we take it to the lake, camping, and hiking. So glad I purchased this!", "It crinkles and mostly held the folds from unraveling it out.It felt like thin fleece over a tarp really.It did keep us off the grass and was large enough to cuddle on though, so it is pretty good for what we want it for.", "It\u2019s a nice size. Soft fabric will absolutely stain if you use it for a picnic.

Rolls up easy and the waterproof bottom is perfect", "Great product", "Looks as pictured. Don\u2019t like the plastic back. Wouldn\u2019t buy again. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s exactly what some would want. Just not for me.", "I love this blanket. I use it at the park all the time. I love the water resistant bottom so grass doesn\u2019t soak thru. It\u2019s easy to fold back up and light to carrry around. Easy to clean. Highly recommend", "Bought this for professional couple photos and it was perfect! There was a slight drizzle during our session and this kept us dry from the wet ground. Highly recommend!", "This is very cheap made.The leather name piece is not in the center like it is suppose to be! I wound not recommend anyone to buy this. They sent a replacement for the one i sent back and it is no better. Alos loose strings and stitching.....", "Such a nice picnic blanket and it\u2019s good for any weather (water resistant bottom). Also super comfy and cozy & easy to clean!", "Love everything about this blanket", "Love this picnic blanket! I\u2019ve used it multiple times.

It's light-weight and waterproof which is great!", "Such a great convenient blanket to keep in the car.

I\u2019m always looking for an excuse to take the family out to a park now. Good quality.", "It's the perfect size!", "Has been durable, makes picnicking a lot easier. Also is very large and comfortably fits 2-3 people", "Exactly what I wanted; a waterproof shell on the bottom that keeps dirt, sand, pine needles etc from sticking to it", "Not large enough", "When you sit down for longer than 30 minutes you can feel the water transfer from the grass onto your leggings/jeans. Additionally, this is very thin.", "classy, great quality and size!", "I used the blanket for a picnic in the high desert. Worked perfectly! Was comfortable as well.", "You really get what you pay for... this was a great choice, you can even take to the beach is super cute and comfortable.", "great purchase", "The one that came in the mail is so much darker in person.

We love the double  belt strap closure.", "Seems to work just fine. :)", "Love this blanket! Super useful great quality! Really hard to wash though", "You can\u2019t put it in the washer", "For the price, it\u2019s a very nice picnic blanket.

Used it for a recent concert.", "Beach", "Just like the description.", "Not as soft as I had expected, but still a good picnic blanket!", "Not as described", "Bought this for a picnic.  It was the perfect size for 2 people and food.  Easy to roll up and carry.  My date was impressed.", "Easy to clean. Nice and big for the family. Love the water resistant underside.", "The blanket is great and just what I thought, however shipping took a long time.", "This is a gift but before I wrapped it I checked it out and it seems good.  i am sure they will enjoy it.", "It\u2019s a very nice picnic blanket! I think it\u2019s good for park picnics and such but I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you\u2019re trying to take to the beach since the felt will possibly collect all the sand grains. My only big issue is that it was a bit of a pain to fold/roll it back up for the straps since it has to be a certain size.", "I\u2019m pretty disappointed actually. The quality of the blanket is VERY cheap. I gave it 2 stars because ultimately it is waterproof & design is nice. But, the material is cheap, I had it for 6 hours and it\u2019s already tearing, and it\u2019s super flimsy.", "I like it, it's soft and big enough for my family of 4. I plan on taking it with us hiking so we can have a nice place to sit when we stop for lunch. Love that the bottom is water proof.", "Super comfortable and soft!", "It is a good blanket but unfortunately it cannot be washed either by hand or in washing machine which is a bit inconvenient as I have a baby who is going to get food and other dirt on it very quickly.", "Love the style and the feeling of the fabric. Very resistant as well. Just wish they would make a darker alternative with the stripes design because the lighter part of the fabric can get dirty pretty quick. Maybe charcoal with white stripes.", "What I love most is how easy (and relatively stylish) it is to carry around. Other picnic mats are quite bulky and annoying but this one you just hold like a handbag. I find the pattern and the leather strap to be quite visually pleasing especially compared to your average may. Haven\u2019t had any chances to see if it\u2019s waterproof yet. Grass isn\u2019t easy to get off it but when is it ever? Never had a problem folding it or tying it up.", "Took this camping and this worked well for my needs. Super light and rolls up well after use. The straps provided look great but aren\u2019t very durable and I don\u2019t think will last long. Provides a great floor mat for the tent and a level of insulation if needed from the ground. Looks quite stylish hanging off the Backpack top.", "Excellent picnic blanket, rolls up with good carry handle for easy transportation", "I use this all the time! It\u2019s large enough for us to have a nice picnic on and looks cute and feels comfy. Also very waterproof underneath.", "This Matt is perfect for picnics and days at the beach \ud83c\udfd6.  It\u2019s very light to carry and folds away easily, good quality would highly recommend this product and brand.", "Lovely product !....love the colours and strapping when rolled ....did the job perfectly in the Cairngorms camping !!", "Sieht schick aus, k\u00f6nnte schon gr\u00f6\u00dfer sein f\u00fcr eine 4-k\u00f6pfige Familie, die Plastik-Unterseite ist gut f\u00fcr Wald und Flur.

Bin auf den n\u00e4chsten Sommer gespannt und werde dann ja sehen ob es h\u00e4lt ;)", "Auf den ersten Blick ist alles i.O.Was man im Original Bild vielleicht nicht erkennt ist, dass die Decke auch hellblaue Streifen hat. Extragro\u00df ist die Decke nicht unbedingt (siehe Ma\u00dfe) aber f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke ausreichend. Laut Anleitung soll man die Decke nicht in der Waschmaschine waschen. Flecken sollen stattdessen nur abgetupft werden. Etwas unpraktisch, deshalb nur vier Sterne.", "Perfekt! W\u00fcrde ich immer wieder kaufen. Sieht edel aus mit dem Lederband.

I bought it to set up a picnic for my boyfriend, and it was perfect! It has  a Really beautiful pattern and neutral colors for any occasion. My only complaint is I do wish it was a little thicker or had more padding for comfort purposes. I brought some pillows with me to help with that.

Waterproof bottom, soft and nice feeling fleece on top, good size for two people, and looks great stretched out or packed.", "This is a great blanket to have on hand for picnics and outings where the grass may still be a little damp.

The carrying strap is useful though takes a bit of fiddling with after the first use to get back on. Overall, a useful and well made item for the price.", "I nanny three kids who love picnics, but make big messes. This has been the perfect blanket for us. The bottom is waterproof so we can sit on dewy grass and not seem like we\u2019ve peed ourselves. Countless drinks and snacks have been spilled on the top and it\u2019s been incredibly easy to wash with no stains. Not to mention how cute it is and how well it goes with my vintage picnic basket. Fridays are now our favorite days because it means we\u2019re having a picnic, and this blanket is a huge part of why I enjoy it.", "Fleece on one side, water repellant on the other. Great size, great look, great price. Can be used for picnics, concerts in the park, football games. The only thing that would make it better is if the handle piece was attached vs. loose when undone, then it would be perfect.", "I love this little picnic blanket! With the shutdowns lately, we've been having park days with our friends where we can get together while still distancing. This little blanket has been great! I'm highly allergic to grass so it's thick enough that the allergens don't seem to get through and the blanket doesn't get wet. It's nice and cushiony too so my bum doesn't get sore when I'm sitting on it for extended periods of time. It's a great bang for your buck and rolls up nicely into the little carrying case!", "Got this for my kids to picnic with. I love how their messes literally just roll off.

Fast ship, soft material & love the secure roll up option...", "I ordered this solely off looks. It's more grey than it looks in the picture, but it's still lovely. The best part of it is the underside. I didn't read the description before ordering but I love that it's water resistant. It looks so cute rolled up in it's carrying case.", "While soft, the blanket came damaged on the underside. This will hinder its \"waterproof\" ability as anything can seep through. The tie included to close and carry the blanket is also really difficult to use and is a big hassle. I think something with a velcro strap would have been better, rather than a faux leather strap. It's like trying to close your belt after you've had all you can eat.", "I really like this, the only problem I have with it is how difficult it is to fold back up into the cute original carrying package.", "This has become a must have! I have put it in the wash and air dried it many times, I keep it in my car all the time, we take it to the lake, camping, and hiking. So glad I purchased this!", "It crinkles and mostly held the folds from unraveling it out.It felt like thin fleece over a tarp really.It did keep us off the grass and was large enough to cuddle on though, so it is pretty good for what we want it for.", "It\u2019s a nice size.

I\u2019m always looking for an excuse to take the family out to a park now. Good quality.", "It's the perfect size!", "Has been durable, makes picnicking a lot easier. Also is very large and comfortably fits 2-3 people", "Exactly what I wanted; a waterproof shell on the bottom that keeps dirt, sand, pine needles etc from sticking to it", "Not large enough", "When you sit down for longer than 30 minutes you can feel the water transfer from the grass onto your leggings/jeans. Additionally, this is very thin.", "classy, great quality and size!", "I used the blanket for a picnic in the high desert. Worked perfectly! Was comfortable as well.", "You really get what you pay for... this was a great choice, you can even take to the beach is super cute and comfortable.", "great purchase", "The one that came in the mail is so much darker in person. Isn\u2019t this light in color at all. I sent it back", "Good", "This blanket it very cute and it is easy to take with you.", "This is an awesome picnic blanket!  We love the double  belt strap closure.", "Seems to work just fine. :)", "Love this blanket! Super useful great quality! Really hard to wash though", "You can\u2019t put it in the washer", "For the price, it\u2019s a very nice picnic blanket. The straps are a little thin but really aren\u2019t needed unless you like the way it looks", "Looks great and well made", "Nice compact size, soft and waterproof, as well as pretty.", "Perfect for summer festivals", "The item would have worked if it didn\u2019t arrive with a hole in the blanket, disappointed.", "Good for picnic", "Comfortable and easy to carry", "Nice picnic blanket. Used it for a recent concert.", "Beach", "Just like the description.", "Not as soft as I had expected, but still a good picnic blanket!", "Not as described", "Bought this for a picnic.  It was the perfect size for 2 people and food.  Easy to roll up and carry.  My date was impressed.", "Easy to clean. Nice and big for the family. Love the water resistant underside.", "The blanket is great and just what I thought, however shipping took a long time.", "This is a gift but before I wrapped it I checked it out and it seems good.  i am sure they will enjoy it.", "It\u2019s a very nice picnic blanket! I think it\u2019s good for park picnics and such but I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you\u2019re trying to take to the beach since the felt will possibly collect all the sand grains. My only big issue is that it was a bit of a pain to fold/roll it back up for the straps since it has to be a certain size.", "I\u2019m pretty disappointed actually. The quality of the blanket is VERY cheap. I gave it 2 stars because ultimately it is waterproof & design is nice. But, the material is cheap, I had it for 6 hours and it\u2019s already tearing, and it\u2019s super flimsy.", "I like it, it's soft and big enough for my family of 4. I plan on taking it with us hiking so we can have a nice place to sit when we stop for lunch. Love that the bottom is water proof.", "Super comfortable and soft!", "It is a good blanket but unfortunately it cannot be washed either by hand or in washing machine which is a bit inconvenient as I have a baby who is going to get food and other dirt on it very quickly.", "Love the style and the feeling of the fabric. Very resistant as well. Just wish they would make a darker alternative with the stripes design because the lighter part of the fabric can get dirty pretty quick. Maybe charcoal with white stripes.", "What I love most is how easy (and relatively stylish) it is to carry around. Other picnic mats are quite bulky and annoying but this one you just hold like a handbag. I find the pattern and the leather strap to be quite visually pleasing especially compared to your average may. Haven\u2019t had any chances to see if it\u2019s waterproof yet. Grass isn\u2019t easy to get off it but when is it ever? Never had a problem folding it or tying it up.", "Took this camping and this worked well for my needs. Super light and rolls up well after use. The straps provided look great but aren\u2019t very durable and I don\u2019t think will last long. Provides a great floor mat for the tent and a level of insulation if needed from the ground. Looks quite stylish hanging off the Backpack top.", "Excellent picnic blanket, rolls up with good carry handle for easy transportation", "I use this all the time! It\u2019s large enough for us to have a nice picnic on and looks cute and feels comfy. Also very waterproof underneath.", "This Matt is perfect for picnics and days at the beach \ud83c\udfd6.  It\u2019s very light to carry and folds away easily, good quality would highly recommend this product and brand.", "Lovely product !....love the colours and strapping when rolled ....did the job perfectly in the Cairngorms camping !!", "Sieht schick aus, k\u00f6nnte schon gr\u00f6\u00dfer sein f\u00fcr eine 4-k\u00f6pfige Familie, die Plastik-Unterseite ist gut f\u00fcr Wald und Flur. Hat nur sehr nach Chemie gerochen und man f\u00fchlt es an den Fingern aber es wird ausdr\u00fccklich gesagt man kann die Decke nicht waschen\u2014 aber eine Picknick-Decke sollte man mal waschen k\u00f6nnen besonders wenn man kleine Kinder hat und die Chemikalien sofort rauskriegen will. Also habe ich sie trotzdem gewaschen- bei 30 Grad f\u00fcr Feinw\u00e4sche- hat sie tats\u00e4chlich ausgehalten,das sanfte Schleudern hat nur nicht ausgereicht,die Decke war noch pitschnass wegen der Plastik-Unterseite. Per Hand ausgewrungen und \u00fcber Nacht zum Trocknen aufgehangen und siehe da-schnell getrocknet. Der Aufwand hat sich f\u00fcr mich gelohnt denn Chemie no Bueno.", "Great quality and looks nice! Would definetly recommend!", "It's perfect. Large enough for 4 people, very nice material and has a layer that isolates you from the grass.", "Great last-minute addition to a garden party. Easy to use, store, clean and take on trips. The simple style means it works with any decor.", "Looks great with the picnic basket", "Fantastic product, excellent value for money.", "Staple for summer picnics. Great quality.", "Perfect size and perfect for picnics in the park", "I got this as a gift. It arrived on time and was as expected.", "Perfect as a picnic rug or any other ground covering to sit on.", "light, good size", "looks great", "Die Picknickdecke wurde z\u00fcgig geliefert. Qualitativ gibt es keinerlei Beanstandungen. Auch wenn die Wiese nach einem Regentag oder vom Morgentau noch etwas nass ist, macht das nichts aus da die Beschichtung an der Unterseite das Wasser gut abh\u00e4lt. Den ersten Waschgang in der Waschmaschine bei 30 Grad hat sie auch ohne Probleme \u00fcberstanden.Optisch ist die Decke auch ein echter Hingucker und zudem durch das leichte Gewicht super bequem mitzunehmen. F\u00fcr zwei Personen also ein perfekter Begleiter im Sommer.", "Sch\u00f6ne, modern aussehende Decke in guter Qualit\u00e4t.Das Design ist schlicht aber total ansprechend. Die Unterseite ist mit Folie ben\u00e4ht, so dass keine N\u00e4sse durchdringen kann. Ganz besonders toll finde ich den trageriemen in Lederoptik...Verleiht dem ganzen einen Vintage- Stil.", "Was soll man da gro\u00df sagen/schreiben!Optisch wirklich sch\u00f6n. Geruchstechnisch war bei meiner alles in Ordnung, aber ich l\u00fcfte solche Sachen immer erstmal aus oder wasche es. Das habe ich allerdings noch nicht getan, da es bei mir immer vor dem Fr\u00fchjahr aufgefrischt wird.Unterseite machte bisher einen guten Eindruck. Bin auf den n\u00e4chsten Sommer gespannt und werde dann ja sehen ob es h\u00e4lt ;)", "Auf den ersten Blick ist alles i.O.Was man im Original Bild vielleicht nicht erkennt ist, dass die Decke auch hellblaue Streifen hat. Extragro\u00df ist die Decke nicht unbedingt (siehe Ma\u00dfe) aber f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke ausreichend. Laut Anleitung soll man die Decke nicht in der Waschmaschine waschen. Flecken sollen stattdessen nur abgetupft werden. Etwas unpraktisch, deshalb nur vier Sterne.", "Perfekt! W\u00fcrde ich immer wieder kaufen. Sieht edel aus mit dem Lederband. Kann in der Waschmaschine gereinigt werden. Klare kaufempfehlung!", "Habe die Decke gekauft, um mit meinem Freund ein romantisches Picknick zu machen. Sie ist super zu transportieren, l\u00e4sst sich einfach zusammenrollen und l\u00e4sst sich danach sogar noch zuschnallen! Hatte da schon ganz andere Exemplare. Sie k\u00f6nnte etwas dicker sein, was auf unebenem Boden bequemer w\u00e4re aber es ist okay.", "Die Decke ist super f\u00fcr ein kleines romantisches Picknick f\u00fcr zwei Personen. Sie macht einen hochwertigen Eindruck und ist sehr schick. Die Decke ist so weich, dass man gut auf ihr schlafen kann und einen tollen Tag mit dem besonderen jemand verbringen kann ;)", "Super praktisch, die Beschichtung h\u00e4lt was sie verspricht war den ganzen Sommer im Einsatz  und ist nach wie vor alles in Ordnung. L\u00e4sst sich klein zusammen rollen und kann somit am Fahrrad oder Roller leicht transportieren.", "If you want to keep it after use like it was before, it'a not that easy but still able to anyway. The surface is nice and quite soft. I have never spilled anything on it so have no idea how's it gonna be.", "Tolle Decke die ihren Zweck voll erf\u00fcllt", "Couverture tr\u00e8s sympa et pratique une fois roul\u00e9e avec son petit kit de transport.Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"pile\" prot\u00e8ge et isole bien du sol pour \u00e9viter de salir et de subir la ros\u00e9e sur l'herbe.Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 face est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able au toucher et plut\u00f4t joli.Elle ne quitte plus le coffre de la voiture en cas d'envie de pique-nique improvis\u00e9e ou simplement de se poser avec notre fille au parc pour profiter de la belle saison", "Est\u00e1 bien est\u00e9ticamente, ha llegado correctamente, etc. Lo \u00fanico que la textura es bastante acr\u00edlica, muy sintetico.", "Il prodotto non \u00e8 male e rispetta le aspettative, la coperta \u00e8 molto grande ad adatta pi\u00f9 a pic nic che ad altro, le cinghie potrebbero essere pi\u00f9 lunghe perch\u00e8 si fa fatica a chiuderle se la coperta non \u00e8 ripiegata perfettamente", "Ich habe mir das Produkt hochwertiger vorgestellt.
