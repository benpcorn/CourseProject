Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).

If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.

I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime.

You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).

I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa.

Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4.

Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7.

They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best.

Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again.

Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help.

I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.

I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3.

I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks.

However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.

They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.

I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed.

Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks.

Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.
The good:1. Good video quality.2. Easy mounting and setup.3. Notification includes snapshot of what triggered motion sensor sent directly to my Apple watch.4. Color night vision (only when spotlight is on) is very nice.The bad:1. Quite expensive compared to alternatives.2. Although video quality is good, I can't believe it's 4k. I don't have anything to compare it too, so maybe it is 4k. I just expected great, not good.3. Battery definitely does NOT last 6 months as advertised! Both cameras were down to about 50% in one week. I bought Wasserstein solar panels to keep the cameras charged. ($69 for pack of 2 vs. ~$100 each for Arlo solar panels)4. Paid subscription required for saving video to cloud ($15/month for 30 days 4k cloud recording or 10/month for 2k cloud recording. By comparison, Wyze gives you 14 days cloud recording for free).5. Beware the 3 month trial subscription that comes with it. Nowhere does it say "free." I discovered that it is a 3 month trial - that you pay for! and at the end of 3 months, apparently, I guess, you get to decide if you want to CONTINUE paying? I'm only 3 weeks in now, so I'm a little curious what will happen at the end of three months. I suspect they just keep charging you. [UPDATE: Reading other reviews, it seems that the 3 month trial service is free? Not sure why they charged me, but I am done fighting with them and I will just cancel]7. Apparently, if you have an Arlo Video doorbell as well, the doorbell must be connected to the Arlo hub or base station, not directly to Wi-Fi, for the doorbell to ring a conventional chime. [UPDATE: this is not true. The doorbell will ring the chime connected to either Wi-Fi or base station. I discovered my doorbell transformer was under-rated for this application, which caused my original problem]  And that leads me to customer service..6. Customer service is horrendous!!! Can't stress this enough. Here is what I am currently going through:I ordered this 2 camera system and an Arlo doorbell at the same time. The doorbell arrived first, so I installed it. Worked great. A few days later the 2 camera system arrived, so I installed it too. Worked great too.A few days later, I discovered that the doorbell was no longer ringing the mechanical chime. Doorbell worked fine when it was the only Arlo device and it was connected to Wi-Fi. After using it for a few days, I added an Arlo base station with 2 cameras. The doorbell was still connected to Wi-Fi and it stopped ringing the mechanical chime.I read somewhere, I though in one of Arlo's documents but maybe not, that if a system has a base station, the doorbell must be connected through the base station or it will not ring a chime. Well, that's annoying! So, I deleted the doorbell from the Wi-Fi and added it to the base station as directed. It still did not ring the chime. So, I deleted it and tried to add again but I can't. Now I am unable to add it to the hub and I am unable to add it directly to Wi-Fi. The doorbell is not discoverable, as if it's already connected to some system but it's not.So I went from having a working video doorbell to a doorbell that would not ring the chime after I installed the base station and 2 cameras to a doorbell that does nothing. I feel like I'm of average intelligence and somewhat tech savvy. I can usually get most things working. Why can't I figure this out??I went to Arlo support for help. I searched all Arlo's relevant documents. I searched google for any assistance. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and tricks I could find. No luck. I want to call someone and start shouting. There is no phone number to call; there is no email address to ask a question; you have to submit a trouble ticket from the Arlo app. So, I did.After 3 days, I received a response from Arlo suggesting that I try some of the troubleshooting aids that I had already tried. I am losing faith in this company very quickly. The response also asked for lots of information including proof of purchase, screen shot of internet upload/download speed, and screen shot that the device really is not installed on my account. I answered all the questions and provided all the information requested. The app only allows 1 attachment, so I attached my sales receipt and had to send the screen shots separately. Odd, why would they tell me to attach 3 things but only allow one attachment? I am questioning my own sanity in purchasing this company's product. I pressed save, and the app crashed. I lost all the information I typed in. I am now losing my will to live. So I redid it all, saved it to a Word document, pressed save, and the app crashed again. Third try: I copied my information from Word, pasted into Arlo support, pressed save - success! Hooray! Small victory in actually sending my request for service.I am now waiting 3 days for a reply that I expect to be totally useless and unhelpful. Wait, there's a weekend included, so maybe I'm waiting 5 days. Either I will get this stupid doorbell working in the next week or I will return everything and buy something else.Update to follow.UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Arlo 5 times over the last 3 weeks. They have been sending me very similar messages with minor additions or deletions to the troubleshooting tips and tricks. I have dutifully complied with all suggestions. I never got the doorbell connected to the base station, but it did finally connect to Wi-Fi again after about 30-40 tries, no exaggeration, just doing the same thing over and over. Also, I discovered that my doorbell transformer was under-rated for the Arlo video doorbell, which caused the original problem of not ringing the chime. It needs to be 16-30V. Mine read 15.6V - I assume just enough to ring the chime when I first installed the doorbell, but not enough to sustain. So, I replaced the transformer and now I've got a working video doorbell again. However, it is connected to Wi-Fi, not to the base station. I really would like to connect to the base station to record to an SD card and to eliminate the bandwidth used on Wi-Fi. My fifth and latest message to Arlo included the question, "I am reluctant to delete the doorbell from the Wi-Fi to attempt connecting to the base station again because of all the trouble I had connecting it at all. It honestly took about 30-40 tries.So, if I do disconnect from the wi-fi and can never get it connected again, what recourse will I have?" Awaiting response.UPDATE-2: After about one month and eight replies to-from Arlo support, video doorbell still cannot connect to Arlo Base Station. Arlo support’s final determination is that my internet service is too slow to connect the doorbell to the base station. They want me to upgrade my internet service and try again. I’m not sure I believe that. If it is the case, then I don't understand why I wasn't told that one month and seven replies ago when I sent my first internet speed screen shot - could have avoided 20-30 frustrating hours of failed attempts to connect the doorbell to the base station. Also, based on their numbers, my other cameras would not work, but they do. Why would my internet connection prevent a low bandwidth video doorbell to connect when two higher bandwidth cameras work with no trouble?I am not in a position to upgrade my internet connection at this time, especially not as a troubleshooting aid that may not help. I prefer to cut costs, not take on extra costs. Following that intent, I will now cancel my Arlo subscription.  Anticipating any potential future problems will not be supported, I have no reason to continue subscribing to any Arlo service.So, my goal here is to warn everyone to do your research thoroughly. Otherwise, you may not enjoy all the benefits that make Arlo systems so expensive. I now know that I am not knowledgeable enough to have asked the right questions or to have conducted the proper research to ensure that an Arlo system fits my need. I could have saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing a competitor's system that would have given me the same reduced features that I get from my current Arlo system.Also, beware Amazon and other places advertise Arlo as compatible with Alexa. From what I can tell, it is NOT! There is no Arlo app for Kindle Fire. There once was but it is now defunct.In all, this was a very expensive, time consuming, frustrating learning process.
Very disappointed. I've been a loyal Arlo customer since it was owned by Netgear many years ago. Decided to upgrade when they came out with 4K quality... Ughhhh! Arlo hasn't perfected the image quality I pay for 4K on subscription service I get 2K at best. Recording in 4K is nonexistent. It is obviously a Failed Beta.  They say up 4K Recording on the local network base station with SD card. $14.99 for 4K subscription, Robery False advertising. Time for Consumer Protection agency complaint after I contact Support one more time. Grounds for a Class Action Lawsuit. Ill update this review if Arlo Support fixes the 4K quality issue. If you want to chance it, and perhaps they have fixed the issue by the time I post this. Otherwise, Keep your packing boxes if you buy, you may end up sending  back to Amazon for a refund.
Arlo's web site states that the lowest operating temperature for my Ultra cams is -4°F (-20C).  However, with the temp now at 5°F, the system reports that the device needs to "warm up" before I can use it.  So, in addition to not working as Arlo states, how will it "warm up" if the temp doesn't get above 5°F - 15°F for weeks?  I can't imagine having to bring the cameras inside every day to warm up!Also, the batteries will not charge if they fall below 32°F/0°C.  So, one must replace the cold batteries with charged spares when the temp drops below freezing, or bring the cameras inside to warm up and charge.  Extra batteries are $50 each!  It seems that it's going to be very difficult to use the Arlo during the winter in most of the U.S.When the camera works, it works great.  I even bought optional outdoor chargers (another $25) , which now seem like a waste of money.  In sum, Arlo's temperature comments are inaccurate.  The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).

The temperature limitations are not described in the item information page.  Moreover, I have a system that's basically unusable for a good part of the year.  I'd guess that at least half the U.S. sees sub-freezing temperatures periodically during the winter months.
I upgraded from the pro2 to the ultra2 and the difference is remarkable. For most things with this camera I would give it 5 stars, but they are quite expensive and the lag time of picking up movement and recording is too slow, therefore, 4 stars.
Great cameras with color vision at night. Detects the difference between animals, people and vehicles. Needs more choices for controlling recordings (ie longer duration). We live on a busy street and it would be nice to have a different notification sound for detection of people versus traffic. Battery life was four days on our busy street. We are in the process of adding power supplies to each of the cameras, so that we don't have to charge them each week. Other than these few items, it is the best surveillance system we have had so far.
They said, "Free local storage - Remotely access your locally secured videos from the included Arlo Smart hub (requires MicroSD card, sold separately)."But refuse to let me access it from my remote hub, because they want to charge me a monthly fee for PREMIUM cloud storage.That is Fraudulent!Don't say that something is available, then hold it for ransom.  Sort of like ransomeware, right?
Having bought seemingly the best to be offered from the range of home-use surveillance cameras - I wasn't expecting such a bumpy ride.First, it was shipped as "Electrical Machinery", which flagged customs and required me to get a special permit (a month delay and some work).Then, having been cleared by customs, it just vanished somewhere at the forwarder system and required several weeks of joined Amazon and mine request to find and deliver it.But that happens.The installation itself wasn't straight forward at all.Apparently, without indication anywhere, you need to open 3 ports )Port Forwarding) within your modem to allow the base to be connected to the system. More work through Arlo support and the ISP.Finally, I've installed it and... You guessed it! Nothing that simple.It seems that Arlo Smart (subscription based 4k cloud recording) is only supported at a short list of countries. So - not here and not in most of the world. I can't even activate the trial sold as part of the product.As to the quality itself:1. The Motion detection works well.2. Night vision is Ok, no more. very blurry.3. The quality of the picture is... not 4k. Streaming (which is still possible) provides you a heavily pixelated picture with very poor color quality and differentiation.Not worth it at all, especially at this price.
This is my second Arlo 2. Had to send the first one back when the battery on both cameras tanked to 0% in one week.  The replacement has been up for 3 days and the battery in both cameras is at 45%. The night vision is poor unless something is directly in the spotlight. Can't tell a thing from even a short distance. Very very disappointed in this product.  In addition, one camera has a green film over the recording and this will not go away. I am not a tech person and for the price of this Arlo I'm not about to be trying to fix it. Do not waste your money.
TLDR: The cameras are excellent, 4k video is awesome, the wide angle view is great. Wireless installation is simple and quick. Cameras are great. The software is clunky at best. "Timeline" mode is not available unless you pay extra and the camera is wired for power. There are cheaper cameras that delivery more on the software side.Full review:The cameras are excellent. They are super simple to use and install. The base station setup is really quick and syncing the cameras is simple. Night vision is decent with the built in "spot"light. 4k video is great (but requires sd card to stream local). Motion tracking works pretty well and identification of the object had been pretty decent in the 3 days I have had the system running. Overall I'm pleased with the cameras functionally and ability at capturing video.The bad side of this system is the software. The system does not allow you to use a timeline mode without having the cameras wired for power and pay for the service. This isn't great. You are completely relying on the motion system to activate to capture a video segment. As I stated it does great but does that mean it's 90% accurate...80%...70%? You have the potential to miss something if the camera only records when motion is detected. I have a much cheaper WYZE camera on my front porch. Motion detection isn't perfect with the camera but it does timeline recording (completely free). I had a bear on take down a bird feeder on the porch, motion not activated on the camera but since it records continuously no problem, I just rolled back until I saw the bird feeder read there and dialed in until I saw what happened. You're not getting that here unless you pay additional money.Night vision is decent but looks so much better when you activate color night vision mode. This is only available if you use the spot light. Well I have accent lighting that the spot light and little more. I'd like to run the same mode without the spot light on, more discreet and less per consumption but that's not possible.Am I dissatisfied enough to return these... I'm not sure. 3 days might be too small a sample size but $500 is a lot of money for two cameras, considering I have a decently functioning WYZE camera that cost me $20 and does more for free and is less clunky than Arlo camera that requires a subscription. (Note I bought the indoor only WYZE cam v2 and have had it outside under cover since March 2020 with zero issues).
