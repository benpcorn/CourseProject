Could not find any info on compatibility with Blue Iris, but with a lot of googling and trial and error I got this combination to work-thought I would pass on to save someone else some grief/time.
Well made camera so I won't have to worry about the case cracking  under the intense Phoenix heat. The swivel feature could be better but if you mount it correctly you should get the angle you want. The sensitivity is a bit touchy. The zoom works well and the images are great in color at night. I've tried 5 different brands and this one is at the top. Setup was a breeze
There are only brief, inadequate instructions on how to assemble and install the camera. It needs only a 2.4 gigahertz router for communication. a dual-frequency router won't work. It's also not intuitive to find the relevant pictures and video after notification of a visitor. It can be adjusted to report only people and not vehicles. I use it with an iphone and Apple watch and get notifications quickly on my watch when a person is detected. I then must go to my iphone to watch the video or get an enlargement of the image. That's where the trouble comes up because the icons are non-intuitive. There is no way to get verbal assistance with the process - only online answers to pre-determined questions.

Not easy to use. Most the time doesn’t catch good wifi. Very annoying

Good resolution, easy to use
