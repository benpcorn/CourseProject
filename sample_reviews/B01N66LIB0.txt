I bought several magazine subscriptions when Amazon had amazing deals. I've subscribed to Women's Day before several years back. I don't remember the many ads. Seem to many to me now. I won't renew.
More ads than anything else. Second time I tried a subscription but not a fulfilling magazine
For many years, I purchased this magazine in the check-out lane at my local supermarket.  It is still a good, informative magazine.
I think it's for a different age range. Like maybe for your fabulous fifties
Fun magazine at with lots of ideas for family activities!
Got this for my mom, I don't read it but she likes it.
Enjoyable and reasonable
Womenâ€™s day is a magazine I enjoy because it has craft ideas and recipes I like.
