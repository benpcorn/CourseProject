I dont know if I got a faulty unit but I've had it for a couple weeks now. The solar panel seem to have come precharged and worked fine but about a week powering the camera then after that the camera switched to its battery. Since then the camera has not been using the solar charger. I've had several sunny days with the solar well oriented towards the sun and it doesn't seem to charge. I've got other solar products that charge pretty well, great concept but cannot give five stars if it doesn't do what it's made to do.Update***I was contacted by a support person from blink and will up update if issue is fixed with a different unit.
I can't wait to try it out when it comes available.
